What's the 'state of the art' in weight loss/fitness? I'm an everyday pleb who wanted to return to being in shape after a covid lockdown break of gaining weight, so I will go through a very casual tour of some fitness and obesity research, mix in some anecdotes, all content that I've found with the help of a basic decision tree algorithm filtering a scrape of primarily 2021 research data to seperate the signal from the noise, then take the average of whatever I find to avoid all the marketing hype and ideology in nutrition and fitness. At the end I will put together a program and try it, see what happens.
</p>

<p>
Consider this merely a Medium-tier poor quality blog post but with 90% less filler and advertising, and I will sometimes point to a single study then in the same paragraph discredit single studies so take with grain of salt. Spelling mistakes and poor grammar/editing will be prevalent because I had 1.5 weeks to write this up in my spare time which is <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/">not so</a> spare.

<p>
Summary: Avoid ideology or moralizing of food choices, eat when hungry, drink when thirsty unless heavily sweating, eat whatever you want as long as you meet minimum daily macronutrients (10% protein, 10% carbs, 10% fats), control your calorie intake and avoid supplement marketing or cherry picked nutritional studies instead take the average of all these studies (which is what I did for this article).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Heavy%20metals%2C%20pesticides">
<p>
I was surprised to learn that there is varying levels of arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium and of course pesticides in spinach, carrots, all fruit, basically anything you eat has some kind of heavy metals in it and if it's a plant likely pesticides too. Taking the average of all recent papers, any leafy greens in particular spinach had one of the highest levels of arsenic, cadmium and lead. Fish that consume other fish had the highest levels of heavy metals where sardines had less heavy metals due to them being on the lower end of the ocean food chain. A few 2021 and older studies found that washing leafy green vegetables with basified water with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) removed almost all of the pesticides and significantly decreased the metals leading them to conjecture that heavy metals contamination was mainly 'foliar deposition' which I assume means aerosol surface contamination of the leaves ie: you can wash it off. As a contradiction microbiome researchers advocate to wash food less so you get increased beneficial bacteria in your gut.
</p>

<p>
I didn't have the time to categorize, sort and average pet food contamination but my scrape found many recent pet food testing studies on heavy metals content in dry pelleted food either plant or meat based, many countries have no specific legislation guaranteeing the content.

<div id="outline-container-Microplastics" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Microplastics">Microplastics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Microplastics">
<p>
Since <a href="https://youtu.be/cZKLBD_LHYw">eating a can of sardines</a>, or whatever other small cooked fish where the bones are not removed and soft enough to eat, is a great source of calcium, vitamin D and essential fish oils I limited my decision tree algorithm on microplastics to mostly sardine and mackerel studies in the sake of time. Vitamin D is a <a href="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-1-back-to-basics">hormone</a> that helps absorb calcium. Because the ocean is filled with <a href="https://youtu.be/gWTyxFcyKOY">plastic trash</a>, let's take a tour of some of the microplastics studies of small fish like sardines and take the average of what we find. 
</p>

<p>
An August 2020 microplastics in sardines <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2020/08/research-reveals-microplastic-content-levels-seafood">study</a> by a Queensland U researcher who in their methods describes going to a local Australian market and buying fresh seafood, claimed sardines have the highest concentrations of micro plastics. However a month earlier, a Western Australia U <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00526/full">study</a> that only analyzed local sardine populations found they contained relatively low concentrations of plastic so completely contradictory. Turns out Australia is a <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/fisheries/aus-seafood-trade">net importer</a> of 70% of their edible fresh seafood, primarily from the South China Sea, and if you go through that site reading about their seafood trade all the locally caught sardines are exported for purposes other than human consumption, and the consumed sardines are all <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2020-10-15/austop-fisheries-sardine-business-bringing-taste-of-italy-to-nt/12733062">imported</a>, that last article lamenting Australia's reliance on sardine imports from Asia being the only option in local fish markets and grocery stores. So the average of 'very bad' to 'hardly any' is maybe there's a threat level of microplastics and fine for me, I'll just keep eating Atlantic ocean sardines moderately every 3 days or so to get essential fatty oils and calcium.
</p>

<p>
In other research, on average microplastics have been found everywhere including freshwater samples in the highest elevation lake in North America leading to the conjecture that microplastic dust exists in our atmosphere and contaminates everything but this was described as 'potentially a problem', where microplastics in seafood had an effect on their health it is still inconclusive it's effect on humans who pass them when consumed however the primary concern of breathing and injesting microplastics is the fact they pick up nasty toxins in our environment that cling to them, not the injestion of microplastics themselves yet anyway.
</p>

<p>
There only exists a single 2020 study I could find of estimates of global average microplastic consumption, which turned out to be 0.1–5g of microplastics weekly (a huge variance, 0.1g vs 5g) through various exposure pathways like drinking water, breathing the air, food, if you want to read it paste the DOI into <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124004">sci-hub</a> (domain changes all the time as governments and publisher lawyers go after sci-hub) but keep in mind, they took averages of previous papers but did not do systematic review on their methods, and we will see soon that systematic review often discredits entire fields of research as a waste of paper (the studies on SIT cardio) because their methods are filled with bias and even sometimes rely on unmonitored compliance or self-surveys. For example the 'microplastics in honey' study that spawned dozens of media articles is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318068276_Lack_of_evidence_for_microplastic_contamination_in_honey">discredited</a> by another study but since this whole guide is to merely take the average, it's probably safe to assume a dust of microplastics covers everything and you're eating and breathing them daily.
</p>


<p>
Conclusion: If you are worried about microplastics you can buy tap filters that claim to '99% remove all microplastics' (obviously verify this marketing). If you are worried about microplastic dust, heavy metals and pesticides on food you can mix baking soda into the water you use wash them, if you are are worried about injesting microplastics by eating fish/seafood then don't eat it, buy fish oil supplements instead but how do you know the supplement itself isn't <a href="http://www.tsachsmd.com/why-i-no-longer-recommend-taking-fish-oil/">filled with microplastics</a> and heavy metals?

<div id="outline-container-Intermittent%20fasting" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Intermittent%20fasting">Intermittent fasting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Intermittent%20fasting">
<p>
Intermittent fasting or IF is a catch all term for numerous different fasting protocols such as feeding time windows like only consume food during a 8-12hr period in 24hrs, only eat during sunlight (circadian rhythm diet) or 5:2 diet, 5 days feeding and 2 days fasting type schemes. In animal models there is many touted benefits but does this translate to humans?
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/aem/a/kvhdD6gGvQsMCBB3QbVry5r/?lang=en&amp;format=html">These guys</a> analyzed all non-animal model time restricted eating studies from 2000 until 2019. Result: inconclusive, and with the highest dropout rates of participants meaning odds are if you try this yourself, you're going to quit. <i>"Intermittent fasting has gained much attention as a popular weight-loss strategy over the last few years. Controlled studies demonstrated that IF (which can have very different protocols) is a safe alternative to daily caloric restriction, with similar weight loss results. Nonetheless, its effects on weight are directly related to caloric restriction and not the metabolic effects of fasting</i>". In other words, under the calories in/calories out model of weight maintenance, IF may help with eating less calories since you can't graze on food all day and have to observe a window of eating time but all it's beneficial effects in animals do not manifest in humans.
</p>

<p>
Taking the average of all 2021 papers on IF, there is no effect either positive or negative to adhering to IF, so it's essentially pointless. However one interesting <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.642999/full">paper</a> is a large Ramadan study in Pakistan and China, how IF promoted beneficial gut bacteria by giving your microbiome a few hours break in work so they could propogate themselves.    
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: IF benefits are inconclusive, though periodic IF like Ramadan may be beneficial to our gut microbiome. I found many warnings too about long IF intervals and excessive calorie restriction that can result in gallstones and other problems in all the survey papers.

This is defined as recurring fasting, specifically 5 or more days of fasting repeated every month or every 3mos+. You cannot do this if diabetic and with other certain conditions you will drop dead unless consulting a doctor. The methods used are either Buchinger method (250 or less calories of soups) or the fasting mimicking diet method (FMD) restricting calories to under 750 for at least 4 days and 1100 for the first day. The 5 day FMD diet is detailed in this <a href="https://libgen.fun/book/index.php?md5=963C4EFDC26D6FCFD2D0EBE1D51A8B28">book</a> and in the papers released by the USC <a href="https://gero.usc.edu/2020/04/22/fasting-mimicking-diet-immune-system-function/">longevity institute</a>. In brief summary (read the book/papers) the FMD purports in human trials to reduce visceral abdominal fat, promote muscle growth, and in animal models works just as well as chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells by promoting body maintenance which then goes around killing off 'bad cells' while under periodic fasting. They found FMD is beneficial if you're undergoing chemo. 
</p>

<p>
The average of other periodic fasting studies concluded it increases Christensenella and other beneficial gut bacteria, so again just like the IF Ramadan study giving your stomach a periodic break from breaking down food is probably worth doing. 
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: worth trying the periodic 5 day fasting mimicking diet though you don't have to pay $300 to <a href="https://prolonfast.ca/">ProLon</a> the company started by the longevity institute director, their original control group studies are freely available to create your own fasting mimicking diet. The book outlines all the medical conditions that make fasting dangerous without doctor supervision so of course, read that too.

<h3 id="Longevity%20diet">Longevity diet</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Longevity%20diet">
<p>
The Longevity diet for adults is another offspring of the USC <a href="https://gero.usc.edu/2020/04/22/fasting-mimicking-diet-immune-system-function/">longevity institute</a> who gave us the FMD periodic fast. It's detailed in the department director's <a href="https://libgen.fun/book/index.php?md5=963C4EFDC26D6FCFD2D0EBE1D51A8B28">book</a> (unfortunately also an autobiography) and <a href="https://www.valterlongo.com/">website</a> (unfortunately filled with marketing). It is similar to a Pescatarian diet and a Mediteranean diet with the following changes:
</p>

<p>
Macros:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>55-60% daily calories from complex-carbohydrates (veggies, grains, pasta and some bread)</li>
<li>30-35% calories from unsaturated fats (3 Tbsp olive oil, nuts, oily fish)</li>
<li>10-11% of calories from proteins (fish/plant protein) of max 0.36g protein per pound of your weight</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unfortunately it is filled with anecdotes, pointing to a single study for much of it's claims (except the fasting research, which should be removed from this book and put into a standalone book). There is questionable nutrient timing advice of 'must never eat 3-4 hours before sleeping' and other nutrient window type schemes that we already saw don't do anything outside of animal models and the origins of this advice are of course, <a href="https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/late-diners-may-lead-to-weight-gain/?lang=en">a single study</a>. He argues you should eat whatever your family bloodline ate, so if you aren't from Peru don't eat stuff like Quinoa or if they never ate Tumeric, then don't eat Tumeric as these ingredients may cause intolerances/inflammation so stick to similar grains or whatever ingredients that your ancestors all ate. The appendix has a fully detailed 2 week diet plan of 1800 calories per day you can adjust to your height/weight, which is almost exclusively dishes from the author's community in Genoa Italy so heavy on pasta and even breakfast cereal, honey, bread etc.
</p>

<p>
The low protein advice comes from <a href="https://pressroom.usc.edu/meat-and-cheese-may-be-as-bad-for-you-as-smoking/">this study</a> that middle aged diets with excessive protein consumption makes you 3-4x more likely to die from cancer as protein controls the growth hormone IGF-1 which fuels cancer cells, while after age 65 IGF-1 drops off and you can add more protein to your diet. <i>“Almost everyone is going to have a cancer cell or pre-cancer cell in them at some point. The question is: Does it progress?” Longo said. “Turns out one of the major factors in determining if it does is is protein intake.”</i>
</p>

<p>
The total abolishment of animal protein and dairy is again based on a single study, where they claimed animal based protein, even within their recommended limits of daily protein for people under 65, still increased growth hormone whereas plant protein did not. As a contradiction a study <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-021-02518-y">from March 2021</a> citing that meat protein study showed that there is no difference between plant or animal protein when it comes to increasing growth hormones or early death, in both large scale population studies and their own test group of middle aged diabetics: <i>Recent large population-based cohort studies extensively correcting for confounding did not find differences in mortality between vegetarians and non-vegetarians</i> and <i>We conclude that animal and plant protein similarly increase IGF-1 bioavailability while improving metabolic parameters and may be regarded as equivalent in this regard</i>. The no meat or dairy recommendation is also partially based on the author's opinion that people are unfit to determine what moderation of protein intake means.
</p>

<p>
The diet recommends taking a fish oil and multivitamin every 3 days as a safety since the author himself is unsure if his plant based diet will result in vitamin and mineral deficiencies when us regular plebs attempt it. However geneticist Tim Spector in his book <i>The Diet Myth</i> has an entire chapter on how useless store bought vitamin supplements are after he had numerous blood tests finding store bought vitamins of all brands were never absorbed by the body, and that if he wanted to continue his vegetarian diet he either had to get an injection from a doctor on a regular basis to maintain those vitamins or 'eat a steak once a month'. There is no comment about this in the longevity diet book, it's just assumed vitamin supplements work as advertised.
</p>

<p>
Many of the other recommendations of this diet comes from taking surveys of long-life communities, which seems to originate from the book <i>The Blue Zones</i> which studies 5 of these communities, one which turned out to not be long lived like Okinawa and has no more longevity than the rest of Japan on average. This Blue Zone book spawned Blue Zones Project LLC which is a heavily marketed, ideological (operated and owned by a vegetarian religious sect) kind of lobbyist group. Going through their marketing this is another forced diet, pushing it's way into hospitals and nursing homes, school cafeterias and large corporations who offer employee catering.   
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: the longevity advice to not eat excessive protein, max 0.31-36 protein grams per your bodyweight in pounds if under the age of 65, to avoid fueling cancer growth hormones is not based on a single study so since I'm just taking averages seems like good advice for longevity and avoiding cancer. The surveys of people over 100 seem purely anecdotal and worthless, and many other recommendations seem to be due to the author's <a href="https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/the-plant-diet-to-save-the-planet/?lang=en">ideology</a> that he is saving the planet, but I'm just a pleb you should read this book yourself it contains great information on exercise, and the second appendix contains a list of common foods and their nutrients.

We can do our own anecdotal surveys of elderly diets and take the average. Here is a an old man in Lebanon claiming to be <a href="https://thearabweekly.com/lebanons-oldest-man-shares-secrets-healthy-life">117 years old</a> (Lebanon did not keep official documentation until 1972, so take with grain of salt&#x2026; but he's clearly old as dirt so probably no very far off from 117) and is still having kids, his youngest is 5 and oldest is 75, walks anywhere between 10 and 40km per day, still doing hard farm labor and chopping wood, and he chain smokes tobacco. This guy <a href="https://youtu.be/68jWeiLdLIQ">is a beast</a>. Here he is @0:38 <a href="https://youtu.be/UsOGvILo7Yc">power walking</a> up an incline while smoking. His longevity advice:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“The secret is in the type and quality of food and eating discipline. I eat as much as I need, don’t go near food that contains ingredients that I don’t know and stay away from manufactured oils sold on the market. Pure olive oil, honey and goat ghee are an elixir for good health and long life and should be at the heart of all meals. Beef meat is harmful but cow milk and yogurt are a cure to all ills, whereas goat milk and yogurt are an effective medicine while sheep’s meat is good but their milk is bad. This is the rule that I follow”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It should be noted his family probably doesn't cook with olive oil, they cook with the ghee which is basically clarified butter to become a pure fat they call <a href="https://palestineinadish.com/recipes/clarified-butter/">Samneh</a> and pastries in the north are often made with sheep tail fat. You dip stuff into olive oil and pour it on everything. A popular breakfast dish there is <a href="https://zaatarandzaytoun.com/lahm-bi-ajeen/">meat in dough</a> a meat pie dipped in yogurt. This diet of tons of dairy products, animal fats and meat consumed daily is very different from the other Mediterranean diet being touted.
</p>

<p>
Some more anecdotes for our survey: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Here is a supposed <a href="https://youtu.be/IKiYIfu8xRg">145 year old</a> Indonesian smoker who's family said he's never had special diet requests. His advice for a long life "Just relax and take it easy"</li>
<li>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/BXyfCGDnuWs">109 year old</a> American that eats high sodium canned soups, drinks whiskey and smokes cigars</li>
<li>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/AV_Nd0SOBBU">121 year old</a> Dagestani 'I eat only what I raise myself, I drink milk and eat milk products, all my vegetables are from my own garden, hard work is good for you'</li>
<li>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/gXG8gRzXPDI">111 year old</a> British man with no special diet. 'Everybody wants to know the secret, it's genetics and take things as they come'.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Conclusion: interviewing centenarians what they eat is great if you want to cherry pick from them to prop up your own nutrition ideology and write a book.

<p>
Matt Might is a compsci professor and author of <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/least-resistance-weight-loss/">Least resistance weight loss</a>. The summary is precisely calculate your daily caloric limits, estimate your caloric intake, and then at the end of the day, ride a stationary exercise bike to burn off whatever excess calories so you lose weight. This is known as the EBT model or energy balance theory meaning calories in are less than calories out and you should lose weight. He promotes doing strength training while you lose weight to avoid losing muscle. 
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: Do strength training if running a caloric deficit, ignore diets and exercise off the excess calories to maintain caloric imbalance (if you are using the energy balance theory model), doing this will force you to make better food choices.

Famously lost 106lbs in 3 months to qualify for the SEAL requirements. There's a lot of misinformation floating around how he did this. <b>You don't want to do this</b> if you watch his interviews he ended up badly injuring himself because of too rapid weight loss which is why he had to do <a href="https://youtu.be/0qGse7ExL9g">BUDS class</a> 3x.
</p>

<p>
Anyway I've read Goggins book so you don't have to, here's what he really did: he made sure he was constantly moving at all times doing his studying on a stationary bike for 2 hours, once in the morning and once at night, and going out to swim/run/lift very light weights but in hundreds of reps. He claims the countless low weight reps he lifted prevented loose skin while losing 100 lbs that fast. He did this every single day for 3 months basically starving himself the whole time, eating only 1 banana for breakfast, and 'a sauteed piece of chicken, vegetables and a thimble of rice' for dinner. He claimed this extreme method was more mental therapy than physical, helping him overcome his old drifting lifestyle as he describes it as 'now I'm on a mission with a purpose in life'. He was too fat to run or do pull ups at first so started out on the stationary bike until he lost enough weight he could do the other exercises.
</p>

<p>
He recently came 2nd place in the MOAB 240 and is a total beast but Kerry Ward is 53 years old and placed <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/m_results_participant.aspx?fname=Kerry&amp;lname=Ward">12th</a> in the MOAB 240 and he <a href="https://youtu.be/50bp4ydFNsQ">films all his runs</a>. He doesn't do any extreme diets if you watch his YouTube channel he just consistently trains.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: this is way too dangerous and articles about him always leave out the injuries he gave himself doing this extreme weight loss. It also requires 3 months of F/T self-torture 16 hours per day which I assume you don't have time for being you need to work to afford housing and food.

A professional boxer who lost 100+lbs. He ate what he calls a 'dirty keto diet' of hamburgers without buns, sausages, cheese and eggs for 3 months while running up a mountain in Spain on a regular basis and training boxing. He claimed his weight gain was from drinking 12 pints a day and eating takeout.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: Reduce carb macros but going full saturated fat keto is unsustainable and also risky according to the studies in the <i>Longevity Diet</i> book, where many participants dropped dead with undiagnosed heart disease that spiked when they went on and off keto diets.

The <a href="https://youtu.be/if27InJBtEI">comedian</a> lost 200 lbs eating steamed broccoli and chicken while doing an insane amount of exercise, which was way too fast and required surgery to fix his loose skin. Here is <a href="https://youtu.be/6VU1r-XEL2Q">another guy</a> who lost a bunch of weight eating chicken and broccoli. Another <a href="https://youtu.be/lZuPOXWjWB4">guy on a keto diet</a> lost 400lbs in 24 months. Scraping for loose skin studies due to rapid weight loss, on average if you are not really obese, if you do a controlled weight loss you won't have loose skin. If you do a meme diet and dump huge amounts of water in under a week, you're screwed.

Conclusion: Do a controlled weight loss unless you can afford skin surgery.

Both used a monodiet choosing the <a href="https://youtu.be/NelIXCuuSZ0">potato diet</a> from the book <i>The Potato Hack</i> which claims you should go on a course of all potatoes with nothing else for a week or two periodically to lose weight. The idea is you don't have set meal times you instead eat a baked/boiled potato whole whenever hungry and as many as you want since you'll always run a caloric deficit. Why they didn't add olive oil to get some kind of healthy fats for energy who knows but they claim it worked. Kevin Smith also joined a weight watchers meal delivery service and that primarily should be accredited to his weight loss and maintenance not the meme potato diet. He claims he was drinking huge amounts of milk per day, and the Bodi tribe in Ethiopia who has a hilarious annual <a href="https://youtu.be/CkHt8MPhSi8">fat man competition</a> that's also how they gain weight, drinking excess milk. 
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: This will work but your muscles are going to disappear too without protein, whatever we select should respect daily macros, and again do a controlled weight loss not a meme weight loss.

<p>
The high fat diet anecdotes above still worked for losing weight, yet they break the energy balance theory (EBT) model, the traditional calories in/calories out model for weight loss. Eating piles of cheese and sausages like Tyson Fury did shouldn't have worked according to the EBT model so something that fell through my decision tree was <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.27.20220202v4">this</a> paper where they claim a mass balance model has superior forecasting and can explain all the above outlier diets. The paper is short, most of it is citations and consists of solving a differential system like you would any other math model. "The food property that has the capacity to increase body weight is its macronutrient mass and not its potential nutritional energy (calories)". They establish a baseline for 140 days then run a simulation on a 2000 calorie per day model using macros of low carbs, and it shows weight loss. Keeping the exact same energy intake (2k calories) they exchange the macros increasing the carbs and run a simulation which shows weight gain, yet the EBT model claims this can't happen because it only models energy.  
</p>

<p>
Summary: "Implicit in the EBT discourse is that body fat accumulates only if fat intake exceeds fat oxidation, even under dietary energy restriction, which explains why this theory argues in favor of low-fat-diets as the optimal fat loss dietary treatment". 
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: Adjust macros to gain or lose weight, ignore the energy balance model.

<div id="outline-container-HIIT" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="HIIT">HIIT</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-HIIT">
<p>
Defined as high-intensity interval training, with no universal standard on session duration it consists of moderately intensive continuous training (MICT) mixed with intervals of repeated short to long bouts of intensity followed by rest periods. Going through the 2021 papers, a systematic review of previous research found that HIIT resulted in a significant boost in testosterone and cortisol levels immediately after a single 30m session, which disappeared after 24 hours back to baseline levels meaning you should only ever do it in moderation unless you want your immune system to stop working and die from a heart attack due to stress being flooded into your bloodstream. 60m sessions produced a greater increase in cortisol. The same review states there wasn't enough controlled studies in the papers they reviewed and had limited data so a real controlled study of HIIT on the body's hormone system needs to be done in the future.
</p>

<p>
Scraping for other papers that tout HIIT benefits, the average I found was HIIT done for 15-30m for as little as 6 weeks, done 3 days a week, preserves VO2 peak for up to 4 years in inactive older adults, meaning even if you stop you retain your peak oxygen uptake. It also was shown to improve 8 indicators of cardiometabolic health compared to 3 for steady state cardio such as blood pressure and total cholesterol. For fat loss on average MICT burns visceral fat and helps you lean out just the same as HIIT does, it's inconclusive whether HIIT is any better for fat burning as you get one study that claims it's great, and another that says there's no difference, and it repeats like this. HIIT 3x a week was also found on average to have reduced impulsivity, and improve short-term memory in a bunch of HIIT psychology studies I found.
</p>

<p>
There's some entertaining papers of surveying young men who <a href="https://youtu.be/nEqhOfG1lwg">drink beer</a> if it affected their HIIT benefits, which turned out to be no, alcohol is fine to consume and receive the benefits of HIIT.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: HIIT has a ton of benefits over MICT but none of them are fat loss as it's inconclusive if one is any better than the other for reducing visceral/body fat. It should be done in moderation or else you may get flooded with stress hormones which take 24 hours to leave your body after a single session. There doesn't seem to be any benefit of doing more than 30 minutes of HIIT per session.

<div id="outline-container-SIT" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="SIT">SIT</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-SIT">
<p>
Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/SHN-4ve81TY">2015 documentary</a> about sprint interval training. In a survey of 2021 papers on SIT the methods were (on a bike) 2 min warmup at normal pace, 3 x 20 second (sometimes 30 second) 'all out' intensity intervals interspersed with 2 mins of recovery normal pace cycling, then a 3 min cool down at normal pace. In total 12.5m or so of cardio done in 28 sessions over 12 weeks resulted in 21% increase in V02 peak oxygen uptake and 6% increase in peak cardio output. 'All out intensity' is defined as pedaling or running like your life depends on it.
</p>

<p>
If you read the 2021 papers, SIT also reduced EGF or epidermal growth factor in older men to the same levels as the younger men in the study, lower EGF is associated with longevity and healthy aging. However, in a systematic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254621000302">review</a> of all previous studies to date (2021), they found all the SIT studies except for 2 were so low quality they weren't even worth the paper they were printed on. If you're wondering how they review, they use the Cochrane <a href="https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current">handbook</a>. As an anecdote SE asian fighting clubs have long used sprint interval training to boost the cardio of their fighters, you go out in the parking lot or alley and sprint from one side to the other in intervals which takes about 20 seconds. 
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: it's inconclusive if SIT is superior to HIIT or even MICT because many of the previous studies were junk tier quality but since I own an exercise bike anyway, and it only takes 12.5 minutes, I may as well do it 3 days a week and be my own test subject.

Bas Rutten has a product on the market called the <a href="https://www.o2trainer.com/">O2 Lung Trainer</a> which he designed after growing up with severe asthma. In interviews he says he would pet an animal and couldn't breathe properly for a week straight, like he was sucking air through a pinched hose. When the attack was over he noticed he had enormous lung capacity after. He claims it cured him of asthma attacks and that COPD doctors use it for their patients to help them breathe normally, and by training his chest muscles like this it helped him go the distance in his professional fights. His amateur study of his own condition also helped him to gas out his opponents, when he would clinch with them he'd squeeze their chest preventing them from expanding and breathing detailed <a href="https://youtu.be/864rQZhvMag?t=3201">here</a>.

How do prisoners get swole when they don't have access to weights? The answer is they are using weights: makeshift weights made out of books or magazines in laundry bags or water in plastic bags, and they do these exercises with an intensity designed to <a href="https://youtu.be/SrygJCc90Uc">split somebody's wig</a>. 'You're doing 1hr of dips, whatever amount of pullups you can do and pushups, nobody counts reps, do it to exhaustion every day like your life depends on it because it does'. This hilarious <a href="https://youtu.be/8CQk5iWoN-A">turbo intense</a> ex-con has a similar opinion that injecting intensity into workouts is how they get jacked in there.
</p>

<p>
Tristar coach Firhas Zahabi recommends <a href="https://youtu.be/_fbCcWyYthQ">consistency</a> over intensity if doing exercises like push-ups which are technical and you only get better at them through consistent practice instead of burning yourself out and taking too much recovery time. Intensity should be periodic. Start at your max reps, divide by two, then everyday build back up to your max reps so you aren't too sore to do it everyday. Most of this advice comes from the book <i>Becoming a Supple Leopard</i> which you can get on library genesis filled with movement advice like how to do a proper pull-up without blowing out your shoulders. Flipping through that book some of it seems anecdotal but the strength building strategy I will put together for myself will incorporate daily increments instead of risking injuries.  
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: injecting periodic intensity into a workout has benefits but consistency leads to more improvements with less injuries over time for sports training and bodyweight technical exercises.

Youtube is filled with ex-con <a href="https://youtu.be/AgEQWaN6qWU">tutorials</a> how to make your own weights like a bag of water in a pillow case, which is probably better to start than buying a gym membership and never going.
</p>

<p>
In this interview of <a href="https://youtu.be/2hFe1WOKOgQ">Dorian Yates</a> he points out people don't take advantage of negatives to totally max out their reps (if the goal is body building and not technical exercises), and that he carefully planned out every single workout and kept a journal to analyze daily and make improvements. The rest of that interview he talks about all the permanent injuries he developed doing this, such as not being able to do any bench press anymore, and that weighted squats were too dangerous for your spine he had to come up with alternative exercises. 
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: get a notebook and plan workouts like a professional would approach planning a business project, it should be a daily schedule prepared in advance so you just take it and execute then analyze later to find improvements, use it to forecast weekly goals. Without a plan you don't get consistent improvements.

<h2 id="The%20Strategy">The Strategy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-The%20Strategy">
<p>
We took a tour of fitness memes and papers. We learned that the EBT model of calories in/calories out is flawed and adjusting macros work better for forecasting weight loss. We learned that reducing saturated fat and excess protein will help us avoid early death. We learned HIIT done for 15 to 30m 2-3 days a week, or possibly SIT done 12.5 minutes 3 days a week, gives you the same cardio benefits of doing 1hr of moderately intensive cardio done at a persistent pace. We learned we should do strength training consistently and mix in periodic intensity. We learned we should do 2.5-5hrs weekly of cardio but it was noted all the benefits are in the first 2.5 hours you do during the week, with the rest optional.
</p>

<p>
Finally we learned we should plan out every workout, analyzing the results to constantly adjust our plan and make it better.

<p>
Get out a piece of paper and plan your fuel intake for tomorrow, based on the longevity diet macros but adjust them if you need to maintain, gain or lose weight so since I need to lose weight, I will increase healthy fats and lower but not eliminate complex carbs. Calculate 0.31-36 protein grams per your bodyweight in pounds to be consumed tomorrow if under the age of 65 and schedule the bulk of this protein, at least 30g to be consumed 1-2 hours after your strength workout if you're doing one. Back in the weight loss anecdotes section we saw that UFC fighter's <a href="https://youtu.be/MgXeNPYFJYM">weight maintenance diet</a> was simple and portion controlled and he ate every couple of hours so wasn't hungry.

<p>
Plan out the routine you will do tomorrow. For the first day, choose all or some exercises you want to try and plan to do them at mild intensity until exhaustion to establish your fitness baseline. If you can't even do one full movemen like a hindu push-up, then time how long you can hold the form until exhaustion or how many negative reps, lowering yourself but resetting and going back to starting form.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you recover, plan the next workout by dividing the reps in half so you can do this everyday. If you could only do one properly executed hindu pushup on the first day, the next workout do it as controlled and slow as possible, which will be harder. Then add in more reps incrementally.

I'm going to try coach Firhas Zahabi's advice of <a href="https://youtu.be/0TRqqfpr98M">shadow boxing</a> @5:01 to build cardio and gain a self-defense skill at the same time, this seems more interesting and motivating than running laps everyday. His advice if you don't have any equipment (paraphrasing): "Do calisthenics for 1 minute, shadow box for 1 minute, repeat that for 15-20 minutes it will be a killer workout to get you really lean". 
</p>

<p>
I picked Muay Boran which is 'old style Muay Thai' meaning street fighting before it became a sport focused style, but you can pick from dozens of <a href="https://youtu.be/D8DouKeOkfI">boxing</a> styles to shadow practice and mix with <a href="https://youtu.be/egwz6f7VM4Y">Filipino dirty boxing</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pWlmlBogVc">stick fighting</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/Tnxdd0JAEAI">Jeet Kune Do</a> whatever personally interests you so you have motivation to practice it.
</p>

<p>
First, watch some tutorials to plan your first shadow routine, if you try some of these while planning, go SLOW without power, master technique they are doing in the videos, and slowly pick up speed over time to not pull every back and ab muscle, later you can learn <a href="https://youtu.be/P6by6LBfo6g">power striking</a>. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Start here</b>: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ltl4PW5H2VY">Northern Thai Boxing</a> (26m) basic body weight technique
<ul class="org-ul">

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Move like they are, move forward throw strike slowly at first, block/move, throw strike, repeat</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mix in some stationary jogging or speed up your footwork to get your heart racing as you can't speed strike yet</li>
<li>Mix in some of <a href="https://youtu.be/7ZtWQFFnWl8">these</a> strength exercises but not full intensity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Or try <a href="https://youtu.be/yH1_6VlzHUc">lunges/squats</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can download these youtube tutorials, and splice them together in any free editing software to make a repeated routine if you want to watch while you practice, like 30m of repeated elbow forms. 
</p>

<p>
<b>First cardio workout</b>
</p>

<p>
Plan a MICT or moderately intensive cardio training routine based on the above shadow forms, meaning you have your heart rate going 70% of max, meaning moderate intervals of bodyweight exercises or jogging in place, some burpees if you can do them, no crazy intense intervals yet until whenever you think you've built up some minimum fitness from zero to maybe can survive a HIIT routine. 
</p>

<p>
When you want to plan a HIIT session it would look like <a href="https://youtu.be/4P8zp4QoE1g">this</a> or the entire <a href="https://youtu.be/7ZtWQFFnWl8">Tiger Muay Thai conditioning</a> notice the style of both, 30-60s of extreme intensity, rest, do some MICT, rest, go back to high intensity, repeat. That Muay Thai strength conditioning workout they do 10 exercises, 15 seconds rest after each one, when finished round 1 wait 2 minutes and repeat again for a total of 3 rounds.
</p>

<p>
This guy's channel has <a href="https://youtu.be/bmVXD9_WprY">full 60m workouts</a> from warmup to cooldown with shadow boxing and HIIT intervals to use as a template or just follow exactly what he does, the length you do it for is up to you remember weekly exercise only needs to be 2.5 hours of primarily MICT for basic heart health with one of those a HIIT session if you're going to bare minimum and get most of the benefits.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Plan the next cardio workout</b>
</p>

<p>
Write down how long you did today's workout for, plan how you will improve this the next day or reduce it so you don't kill yourself and can do it on a regular basis with steady improvements. If you filmed yourself critique your form and make adjustments. Maybe try a new form to shadow like Muay Boran <a href="https://youtu.be/5LQ7MFWjdTs">punch shadow</a>.

<b>Street defense</b>    
</p>

<p>
Reminder this is only for keeping fitness interesting by building up a skill, hardly any of these moves are safe to use in a street fight without heavy bag conditioning all your limbs or at least aqua bag conditioning your hands and elbows. Throwing a round kick in a street fight without conditioning on a heavy bag is a guaranteed way to screw up your shin, sprain ankle if you miss the target because you don't practice against a moving bag, or break your foot. Throwing a high teep push kick you can blow out your groin or they could catch it and you're screwed. For self defense, you can use risk the vertical bareknuckle jab, push kick only below the waist, Lerdrit knee, headbutt and clothesline or back of the ear palm strike, maybe some of the elbows if you must in the street.
</p>

<p>
Because you now carry yourself differently in public as you have increased confidence, it is less likely that somebody will single you out for an assault, and even more unlikely if you always show respect to everybody you encounter at all times, then nobody has to check your bad behavior in the street leading to a preventable fight. The above information was collected from bareknuckle boxing videos, Bas Rutten recommendations from his days a nightclub bouncer, and Firhas Zahabi if you want to watch them yourself but it's also just common sense.

Stretching is included with the Hindu squats and push ups, the movement warmup, and practicing the hip escape drill too but there is many recommendations that consistent stretching post-workout leads to less injuries though I found no studies about this, it's all anecdotes. You can easily build your own <a href="https://youtu.be/NsslSF7_m0c">stretch routine</a> for post-training with the ample amount of advice on YouTube or do Yoga. For me it's worth doing end of day you can watch something like a lecture and stretch out at the same time.
