For geometry themed entertainment try reading <a href="http://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=B290F008ACE9DE45827692ED7A4CB944">Isaac Newton on Mathematical Certainty and Method</a> by Niccolo Guicciardini as you go through the geometry problems here, as Newton claimed geometric synthesis helped him make mathematical discoveries when writing <i>Principia</i> by performing geometric synthesis on the cause to prove the effects he observed through analysis..
</p>

<p>
Isaac Newton entered Trinity College in 1661 as a <a href="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03996/1">sub-sizar</a> meaning subsidised tuition in exchange for being an unpaid servant on campus. Cambridge then was just a diploma mill, there were seldom any lectures and fellows (graduate students) acted as P/T tutors to supplement their income. Undergrad degrees consisted of one of these tutors giving you a list of books to read. According to his Trinity College notebook which Cambridge still has, this was a large reading list of Greek and Roman classics in Latin: Aristotle's <i>Organon</i> and <i>Metaphysics</i>, Porphyry's <i>Isagoge</i>, Plato and manuscripts of commentary on Aristotle usually written by other fellows to sell to undergrads. This was because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_of_Aristotle">recovery of Aristotle</a> in the middle ages which shaped logic courses for the next few centuries. Newton didn't read much of Aristotle or any of the books assigned to him, but he later claimed he read enough to have learned how to properly categorize a problem, how to think logically, and later when he wrote the <i>Principia</i> how to use a cause to prove the effect. His algebra lectures that later became the book <i>Arithmetica Universalis</i> described different 'species' ie: Aristotelian categories of math objects that can be combined together, essentially he was describing types. 
</p>

<p>
According to Newton's notebooks and the writings of his close friend DeMoivre, here is how Newton learned mathematics. Wandering the town fair in 1663 he comes across a book on astrology, and out of curiosity buys a copy as Newton was always into alchemy and other occult topics. It features trigonometry he doesn't understand so he goes to the mathematics department of Cambridge to find books on trig only to discover everyone there is deeply immersed in the work of Descartes. They give him Euclid and Oughtred's <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-oughtreds-clavis-mathematicae">Clavis</a>. He retries Euclid's <i>Elements</i> after having given up reading it before, and sees the proof of the Pythagorean theorem which makes him want to read the rest of the text. Newton's college notebooks show he was influenced by books II (geometrical algebra), V (proportions), VII (number theory) and X (irrationals) and that Euclid taught him how to write a proof while Aristotle's system of logic he studied gave him the rigorous thought to be able to follow the proofs.
</p>

<p>
Since his Cambridge degree is essentially a joke, with the school so lax nobody cares what you're doing, he abandons the official curriculum for the rest of his undergrad to hang around the math department. He pursues Kepler and Oughtred's book, writing he understands it except for the quadratic and cubic equations however his takeaway in his notes is that algebra can used for exploration, which he starts doing writing out himself hundreds of examples. He gets a B.A. in 1665 despite never finishing any of the official curriculum and is offered to be elected as a minor fellow pursing a masters but the school is closed because of the plague in the summer of 1665.

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Cartesian Geometry by Van Schooten <a href="https://www.manhattanrarebooks.com/pages/books/2043/rene-descartes/geometria?soldItem=true">rarebooks</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
He goes home to his family farm and takes with him a 1659 two volume Latin translation of Descartes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_G%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie">La Geometrie</a> by van Schooten with appendices and commentary by other Cartesian research mathematicians. Newton later writes in his school notebook how a proof by Hudde to estimate the slope with a tangent in the appendix taught him how to transform one type of problem into another to study it in a different way. This book was considered a very hard text and the state of the art of 17th century analysis which uses almost the same notation we use today. He read 10 pages or so, couldn't understand the text, and reread from the beginning. Went a little further then stopped again going back to the beginning. He repeats this algorithm for all summer and autumn until he finally finishes the whole text. He misunderstands a technique of Descartes to his own benefit where he thinks Descartes is hinting the reader can figure out any properties of a curve and while trying to do so as an exercise develops his own sophisticated analysis well beyond the book or any other book of that time. During this period is when he started working 18 hours a day, 7 days a week. He didn't stop this work ethic until he died, even after becoming extremely wealthy and living in London with teenage neice's who wrote he would be up until four in the morning working on something. 
</p>

<p>
In the winter of 1665 he reads <i>Arithmetica Infinitorum</i> by Wallis which is the arithmetic of infintesimals and Viete's <i>Opera Mathematica</i> another very large book. In less than a full year Newton managed to bring himself completely up to date with the entire achievement of mid 17th century mathematics by himself. At this point he discovers the generalized binomial theorem and infinite series analysis which he invented to find short cuts to calculations. He returns briefly in 1666 to Cambridge before it's shut down by the plague again, his notes revealing he finished his differential and integral calculus during these few months back at school.  
</p>

<p>
Describing his activities during the second plague year: "I am ashamed to tell to how many places I carried these computations, having no other business at the time, for then I took really too much delight in these inventions". There is notes he kept of calculating a logarithm to it's 52nd decimal point. He returns to Cambridge in 1667 and sometime during this period he becomes obsessed with uncovering the ancient analysis used in classical geometry. Pappus' book 7 contains a commentary about a lost group of tools and propositions that Euclid, Apollonius, Eratosthenes and other geometers of the day used which Pappus referred to as the 'treasury of analysis'. These lost Porisms (corollaries) are theorized by Newton to be <a href="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03963/1">projective geometry</a>.
</p>

<p>
Newton in his Lucasian chair lectures said that the ancients would never bother to introduce the algebra of curves with geometry because you lose the simplicity of working within geoemtry, it's whole point was to escape the tediousness of calculations by simply drawing lines and circles. He also claims books like Pappus's <i>Collectio</i> deliberately hid the analysis, as it was considered an inelegant tool and that ancient synthesis where they deduced a consequence from a given premise (a corollary) using visual means was a superior method as the analysis could not be reversed in steps like geometric synthesis could. He went further and claimed if you wanted to discover seemingly unrelated corollaries you had to use synthesis, describing the analysis of his day as a 'tedious pile of probabilities used by bunglers'.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Arithmetica Universalis</i> which is an unauthorized book released by his successor at Cambridge who discovered Newton's Lucasian lectures in the library and published them as is, Newton writes how Descartes' attempts to include into standard plane geometry various curves like parabolas more than just a waste of time, they are 'ruining the simplicty of geometry'. In figure 108 he shows how he would solve this problem, by reinterpreting an ellipse, arguing the Cartesian methods fail to understand the point of doing everything with just a ruler and compass. 
</p>

<p>
He later wrote in a manuscript on geometry that mechanics of motion was what generated all geometry, and that the ancients had understood this as well conceiving geometrical objects as generated by moving along a straight edge, circles via the movement of a compass, or translation like in Proposition 4 of Book 1 of Euclid's <i>Elements</i> where one triangle form is moved to compare to another. He then demonstrated that mechanical rotation of rulers were in fact transformations of the plane something that wasn't formally developed by other mathematicians for another 200 years.

<p>
Newton invented limits when writing the <i>Principia</i> during the geometric synthesis stage of his infintesimal analysis. He decided limits demonstrated as geometric vanishing augments to be 'more in harmony with the geometry of the ancients in that there should be no need to introduce infinitely small figures into geometry'. Since infintesimal analysis was merely a heuristic tool to him, he downgraded infinitesimals (which had no established theory with proofs anyway) to prefer his new limit proof method he derived from geometry synthesis, and is very similar to what everyone today is using in modern calculus courses.

The model for basically all mathematical reasoning:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>AND \(\land\) (conjunction)</li>
<li>OR \(\lor\) (disjunction)</li>
<li>NOT \(\neg\)</li>
<li>Implies \(\implies\) is only false when A is true and B is false</li>
<li>Iff (if and only if) \(\iff\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
These connectives can of course be used to define each other:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A \(\implies\) B is \(\neg\) A \(\lor\) B
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>implication is only true when either A is false OR B is true</li>

<p>
If a = b then you can substitute a for b, here's an example of using substitution to transform a hard problem into something more familiar: 
</p>

<p>
Solve two systems of equations:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\((3x + y)(x + 3y)\sqrt{xy} = 14\)</li>
<li>\((x + y)(x^2 + 14xy + y^2 ) = 36\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Substitute \(\sqrt x\) = u, \(\sqrt y\) = v:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>uv(3u<sup>4</sup> + 10u<sup>2</sup>v<sup>2</sup> + 3v<sup>4</sup>) = 14</li>
<li>u<sup>6</sup> + 15u<sup>4</sup>v<sup>2</sup> + 15u<sup>2</sup>v<sup>4</sup> + v<sup>6</sup> = 36</li>
</ul>

<p>
Multiply the first by 2 and add both together
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>36 + 2 · 14 = u<sup>6</sup> + 6u<sup>5</sup>v + 15u<sup>4</sup>v<sup>2</sup> + 20u<sup>3</sup>v<sup>3</sup> + 15u<sup>2</sup>v<sup>4</sup> + 6uv<sup>5</sup> + v<sup>6</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>
That's the binomial expansion of (u + v)<sup>6</sup>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>64 = (u + v)<sup>6</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>
And you can keep going, these are the kinds of techniques we'll learn

The <a href="https://youtu.be/E6FdfJOj7CY">Aristoteles Latinus</a> project probably has the best <a href="https://stories.kuleuven.be/en/stories/aristoteles-latinus-jigsaw-puzzling-for-experts">translations</a> they collect all ancient manuscripts like the Boethius translations and then compare them to others, presenting the original Latin, and sometimes ancient Greek with the English translation beside it containing the best estimate of modern language, and a full codex in the index so you can <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/learn-latin-from-the-romans/C745F49A9DAB318C5DC3BED3731C2D19#overview">read the Latin yourself</a>.

<p>
The same project also translates the ancient Syrian and Islamic empire manuscripts as these civilizations had direct access to many of the original Greek texts, again including the original Syriac or Arabic beside the translation with a codex in the index.

To teach yourself logic, you could also try <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/LACI/">Logic and Computation Intertwined</a>. Described as a short stroll through proof assistants by building one yourself, Prof Ragde explains dependent types, propositional logic, predicate logic, and the constructive style logic used to model a proof and then run eliminations on it to verify it is correct. It uses Racket (Scheme/Lisp) anybody can follow. Fully demystifies how Coq and Agda work. He will also teach you how to <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/747/notes/index.html">prove facts in Agda</a> about programming languages if you want to learn proofs by induction. These notes are filled with ascii casts of him working out the problems in Emacs. The notes follow the Agda <a href="https://plfa.github.io/">book</a>.  
</p>

<p>
If you like this style of logic try a <a href="https://youtu.be/JRG_TsNXFi8">proof theory seminar</a> by Frank Pfenning w/<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15816-s10/lectures/01-judgments.pdf">notes</a> to learn more about natural deduction. The Per Martin-Lof <a href="https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/research/publications/journals/njpl/files/vol1no1/meaning.pdf">lectures</a> nicely accompany the seminar and are probably the best explanations you will ever read with precise clarity of the rules of inference, connectives, judgements and how eliminations work. In this theory a proof is a concrete object you construct and can test like a program. If you can't construct it, it's not a proof.

<p>
Exercise: Prove why the multiplication and distributive laws work. Since we have no idea what a proof is yet, we can instead try going through some of our own examples.   
</p>

<p>
Identity law: n \(\cdot\) 1 = n.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We are creating n groups of 1. According to our definition of multiplication |||| \(\cdot\) | would be 4 groups of | or ||||. This is still 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Commutative law: nm = mn. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>||| \(\cdot\) || = || || || or 6. Rearranging this, || \(\cdot\) ||| is ||| ||| which is again 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Associative law: (kn)m = k(nm).  
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k = |, and n = ||, and m = ||| and parens expressions are evaluated first:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Left side: (kn)m. We first evaluate (kn) as || (2 groups of 1, the identity law), and 2m is ||| ||| (2 groups of 3) for a total of 6.</li>
<li>Right side: k(nm): In the parens nm is 2 groups of 3, so ||| |||.  k(6) is the identity law, one group of 6. Thus (kn)m = k(nm).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Distributive law: (k + n)m = km + nm.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k = ||||, and n = ||, and m = |:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Left side: (|||| + ||) is 6, and (6) x 1 is six groups of 1 or 6 according to the identity law.</li>
<li>Right side: km + nm: 4 groups of one is 4, plus two groups of 1 is 2 (identity law). Answer is again 6.</li>

Note to remove parens: <a href="https://www.themathpage.com/alg/parentheses.htm">https://www.themathpage.com/alg/parentheses.htm</a> we can drop the grouping enforcement when using addition (associative law) but must distribute the negative sign, as subtraction is not associative.

The rational number line sits on [0, 1], so you don't end up with a zero denominator which isn't defined. A rational number is a line through the origin [0,0], and an integer lying on point [m,n].

Wildberger has a basic introduction <a href="https://youtu.be/UsQsV8VsCxw">lecture</a> using natural numbers that assumes you know nothing about exponents and reviews the hindu-arabic notation, showing how to convert a decimal to a fraction. The second <a href="https://youtu.be/Sid7ocFsIF0">lecture</a> introduces rational number decimals and their visualization. 
</p>

<p>
His definition is a decimal number is a rational number a/b, where b is a power of 10 (hence deca/decimal), then shows various examples how you can manipulate rational numbers like 1/2 to be 5/10, or 0.50, we also find out why 1/3 is not a decimal number. In binary, which is a base-2 system, the only prime factor is 2. If you load up any language interpreter and try and add 0.1 + 0.2 you will get surprising results, typically this number: <a href="https://0.30000000000000004.com/">https://0.30000000000000004.com/</a> because of the way floating point is used to represent decimals.
</p>

<p>
At 36:00 arithmetic w/decimals is covered, showing how the rational number and decimal number arithmetic methods are the same so you can just stay w/rational numbers if you want converting back to decimals at anytime.

Watch the first 20 minutes of this lecture and you'll see what the notion of an epsilon displacement is. The rest of the lecture is excellent covering a different definition of limits but optional edutainment if you're interested.

<p>
We are now starting to learn what 'real numbers' are. They will come up in everything you read without a definition. For now just think of them as a convenient abstraction so you can do magical things in continuous mathematics. Terence Tao's <i>Analysis I</i> has a very good and thorough treatement of them which you should read but I won't include it here.

Wildberger is a skeptic of many aspects of modern mathematics. This doesn't mean your education is totally obliterated by hearing from a skeptic, and it also doesn't mean I agree with him either. It just means here is some non-standard analysis of these types of math objects and concepts presented in a totally different way that the status quo, maybe it will be more helpful because if you're like me, the standard curriculum is not helpful.

Watch from 2:20 to 16:00, he shows the 2D geometric interpretation of Cauchy sequences, and how they are interpreted as 1D on the real line, the idea of 'converging sequences'.

He explains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality">triangle inequality</a> around 8mins, if you ever take an analysis course they will use this inequality for many proofs.

An excellent lecture why we even need these complex limit and real definitions in the first place, showing how limits make many subjects in analysis much easier. Archimedes bracketed measurement is covered when he tried to figure out the approximation of pi. We also get an introduction to transcendental functions as a geometric series in other words standard trigonometry functions. The next lecture in the series is optional but Wildberger presents an alternative definition of real numbers, using Archimedean style of nested intervals where equality, algebra laws, order etc are all trivial to prove.

What is a <a href="https://youtu.be/z_75zzqXVnM">math circle</a>? It's how they have taught math in eastern Europe for over a <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/prb-23">century</a> essentially an informal group of all ages from professors to grad student TAs, to elementary school kids all get together to group solve a problem and repeat. Read the preface of <i>Mathematics via Problems: Algebra</i> for a full description.

Let's start with <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~ploh/cmu.shtml">Poh-Shen Loh's</a> CMU course on discrete mathematics. This is conceptually easy to understand, beginner combinatorics demonstrations so you see for yourself how you solve a problem.

<p>
The <a href="https://youtu.be/0K540qqyJJU">first</a> lecture begins ~14:30 mins. Carefully note what's going on, you are just throwing out little ideas for strategies and writing them all down investigating as you go. TODO
