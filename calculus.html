<b>I replaced this with <a href="./themathyouneed.html">the math you need</a></b>

    
Here we learn some single/multivariable calculus, from the perspective of modeling with it. The first iteration is a casual survey of the material, programming some math if you want using R or any language you'd like. The second iteration is working through the free problem book <i>Advanced Problems in Mathematics: Preparing for University</i> written to help students prepare for <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/admissions/step">STEP</a> university entrance exams. The idea is to be more economic with out time, and actively learn with a challenging problem per day instead of doing high amounts of repetitive typical textbook end of chapter problems that are all cherry picked nice examples that don't really teach you calculus, and you will end up forgetting what you learned a month later. Instead you will figure it all out yourself and always remember how you did it, no flash cards, no spaced reptition, no other tricks needed.   
</p>

<p>
You could alternatively try learning this with a subject where you will actually use this material, such as <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/ai.html">machine learning</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9_jI1bdZmz2emSh0UQ5iOdT2xRHFHL7E">graphics</a>.

<p>
Discrete summation notation and arithmetic/geometric series, this is optional you can watch it later when summation comes up. There are slightly different properties for 'infinite convergent series' we'll learn those later too.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(YouTube) <a href="https://youtu.be/rQzfHbkltkY">Summation &amp; Sums of Powers</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note use of brackets:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(\sum_{i=1}^n\) i + 1 = (1 + 2 + 3..) +1</li>
<li>\(\sum_{i=1}^n\) (i + 1) = (2 + 3 + 4..)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The summation rules ~@10:30, expand the sum/remove the sigma notation and the rules make sense
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(\sum_{i=1}^{3}ca_i\) = c1 + c2 + c3</li>
<li>c\(\sum_{i=1}^{3}a_i\) = c1 + c2 + c3</li>
<li>c(1 + 2 + 3) = c1 + c2 + c3</li>
</ul>

<p>
Write your own examples for the constant difference rule of an arithmetic sequence:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sequence a<sub>3</sub> = 10<sub>1</sub>, 20<sub>2</sub>, 30<sub>3</sub></li>
<li>Example index a<sub>1</sub> = 10, a<sub>2</sub> = 20 ..</li>
<li>d = (20 - 10) = (30 - 20) or d = 10</li>
<li>To find a<sub>4</sub>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a<sub>4</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + d(k - 1)</li>
<li>a<sub>4</sub> = 10 + 10(4 - 1)</li>
<li>a<sub>4</sub> = 40</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Do the same for arithmetic series: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

Try the Brown University trig <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/dkatz/trigbootcamp/">bootcamp</a> in summary there are 3 triangles who's measurements you should know, you scale them down to the unit circle size, and then use them to figure out points on the unit circle ie: trigonometry.

Reading Chapter 1.1 of <i>Mathematical Modeling and Applied Calculus</i>. Skim this chapter it probably contains things you don't remember. You can always jump to the end of chapter exercises and try enough of them to justify skipping this chapter but this is a different book than most math texts and often has important things to point out that we will come across in later chapters.
</p>

<p>
In case you forgot highschool and the <a href="https://youtu.be/a6Pk-kbzhxA">Cartesian plane</a>, the inputs are the horizontal line and outputs are the points on the veritcal axis. All this does is conveniently represent an input/output relationship with a visualization of displacements.
</p>

<p>
We are also introduced to our first math <a href="https://youtu.be/zrt0EKuGr5Q">data structure</a>, a tuple or an ordered pair of values enclosed in brackets like (1, 2). This is similar to the idea of a list in programming, somebody needed a way to represent values in math in which the order matters and duplicates could be possible like (3, 3), so invented a tuple structure.
</p>

<p>
Page 8: Question 2: obviously (c) and (b) have numerous y outputs for a single x input. The definition on the same page claims 'every function in this book is contained in the real numbers' which you can read about in the math workshop if you're interested. Rationals, integers and natural numbers are all contained in the real numbers but <a href="https://youtu.be/XoTeTHSQSMU">complex numbers</a> or whatever other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_numbers#Non-standard_numbers">number object</a> abstractions aren't.
</p>

<p>
Example 4(c), they throw in set theory notation (union) without defining it. If you're interested <a href="https://youtu.be/59WX2V7Vjgg">watch</a> a lecture on sets and functions. They also use interval notation without defining it which you can search for on YouTube yourself.
</p>

<p>
Question 4: Identify the domain of each function. (a) clearly can be anything, (b) can be any negative number, since 4 - (-4) is 8, and 0, 1, 2, 3 to avoid being a negative square root, so (-inf, 4) if we are using interval bracket notation to exclude 4. (c) every single input maps to the same output, so it's domain is the entire 'real numbers'.
</p>

<p>
Example 5 is much easier if you include brackets f(x) = \((3)\sqrt{x} - 5\) now you know exactly what to do, take the square root of x and multiply it by 3 and subtract 5. Anytime you see math notation jumbled together like this it means multiplication but brackets are never included for some reason.

<div id="outline-container-RStudio" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="RStudio">RStudio</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-RStudio">
<p>
Reminder we are just using RStudio as a glorified calculator, you don't need to know how to program and can easily figure this out yourself. The <i>working in R studio</i> aside you can do this <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/">online</a> instead of having to install anything locally if all you have is a phone, meaning work in your browser if you want. The instructions are in the appendix, make a throwaway gmail account, open new project on r studio, first thing you type:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga8fa947">
install.packages(c("MMAC", "mosaic", "mosaicCalc", "manipulate"))
</pre>

<p>
The 'c()' is a "vector" meaning multiple inputs to the install.packages() command. This command is actually install.packages(c) where c is filled with entries. Then you have to include all these libraries as written in require statements in the aside on page 12:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org630f2dd">
require(MMAC)
require(mosaic)
require(mosaicCalc)
require(manipulate)
</pre>

<p>
Which means if you're using the console, where you type in something and it evaluates each line, then you have to paste in those require() statements to let the program know where to look to use those built-in functions like 'mosaic'. These libraries 'MMAC, mosaic' etc are mainly data sets the book uses in later chapters we will import and then model. 
</p>

<p>
I rewrote <i>Example 7(d)</i> to make it more clear:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org14b2f52">
abs( (2^3 / 4^5) - (9^8 / 6^7) )
</pre>

<p>
I'm not sure why they use (2<sup>3</sup>)/(4<sup>5</sup>) style brackets but whatever, either works. This command is actually abs(thing) where thing = ((2<sup>3</sup> / 4<sup>5</sup>) - (9<sup>8</sup> / 6<sup>7</sup>)) and now you are getting the gist of programming. I also rewrote the aside on page 13 from f=makeFun(8*x+4~x) to the following to make it more clear, translated this means make f a function, where the body is 8*x+4 and the parameter for f is x. 
</p>


<pre class="example" id="org6f3c60c">
&gt; f = makeFun( ((8 * x) + 4) ~x)
&gt; f(3)
[1] 28
</pre>

<p>
And I rewrote the plotFun example, translated this means plot function ((-4 * x) + 8) where the input is x, and limit the visual range to (-5,5) 
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org72f9a79">
plotFun( ((-4 * x) +8)~x,xlim=range(-5,5) )
</pre>

<p>
<b>Question 9</b> Graph a line with a specific domain in RStudio:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org90f9c4d">
&gt; line = makeFun(((-3.546 * x) - 9.128)~x)
&gt; plotFun(line(x)~x, xlim=range(-15,15))

Try experimenting with syntax
This works too because we already declared line a function with (x) input
Translated: plotFun(function, display-options)

&gt; plotFun(line, xlim=range(-15,15))
</pre>

<h2 id="Day%202%20Exercises">Day 2 Exercises</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Day%202%20Exercises">
<p>
Trying some of the chapter 1.1 exercises. The only non-functions I see in Ex 7-14 are 10, 13 and 14 because the same input has different outputs (3.14 is not the same object that pi is). All of these you can answer in your head in a couple of seconds. 
</p>

<p>
Ex 34 can be rewritten \(\sqrt{x}\) + \((1 + x)^{\frac{1}{4}}\) search for rational exponent rules. We can't have a negative square root so you have take into account \(\sqrt{x}\) meaning the domain is the entire positive real numbers and zero. 
</p>

<p>
Try changing all these exercises to an equivalent form from the Wildberger basic arithmetic lectures in the beginning of this workshop. For example Ex 37 can be rewritten \(\frac{\pi}{x^2 - 9} \cdot \frac{x}{x}\) and now it's obvious what to cancel to simplify this problem to a domain that avoids x<sup>2</sup> - 9 being 0.
</p>

<p>
Ex 35 we only care that the denominator is not 0, since a/b + c/d = ad/bd + cb/bd then the denominator is 4x<sup>2</sup> + 20x or 4x(x + 5) and x can't be -5, or else we get 4x(0) which is 0 or -20(-5 + 5) which is 100 - 100 or 0.
</p>

<p>
I like exercises 91 to 100 where you have to in your own words explain all the topics the chapter presented. This is known as the <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/11/25/the-feynman-notebook-method/">Feynman method</a> where you attempt to explain concepts to an invisible audience in the most simplest terms anybody can understand, and if you find yourself stumbling then you go back and reread those concepts, or practice some exercises until you can effortlessly explain 91 through 100. When you explain to yourself, remove any words like conjecture or even data. Imagine somebody is sitting in front of you asking you to define every word you use, and wants to know exactly what data means (tip: they often will do this in those annoying software developer interviews). It took me about an hour to do a random sampling of the 100 exercises for Chapter 1 so congrats, you're done for today.

This chapter is a review of <a href="https://youtu.be/BtcKotD6Ni8">linear</a> functions you probably already know from highschool, <i>Parameters of Linear Functions</i> is interesting showing shifts and the section on Monotonicity which will come up again. Their definition of monotonicity has no concrete examples, but if (a, b) is an interval, then c and d are two numbers within that interval, and if c &lt; d then f(c) &lt; f(d) means the function is increasing. ie interval (1, 10) for f(x) = x + 1 and f(5) &lt; f(6) ergo this is an increasing function.

Before you read this chapter watch <a href="https://youtu.be/m2MIpDrF7Es">this</a> tutorial about the constant e why it's often used to model something who's growth is itself, especially the end of the video where he shows how since all a<sup>k</sup> functions behave the same as e, we just end up modeling with e and some parameter(s). We haven't learned the chain rule or derivatives really yet except the beginning crash course vids so you can skip those if you want and still be able to understand most of the tutorial.

Parameters for C\(e^{kx}\) or C\(e^{k(x-h)}\)

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>C is the y-intercept (shift along y-axis)</li>

There must be errata for Example 6, Figure 12. If f(1) = e<sup>k1</sup> if k is negative you get y = 0.367 which clearly is graph(b) going down towards x-axis, because e<sup>-kx</sup> results in y = 1/e<sup>kx</sup> meaning y gets smaller and smaller. If you input x = -1, with negative k you get graph(b) again. Skim rest of chapter, like the exponent rules if you forgot them. You don't have to memorize the formulas for halving or doubling time since you can always come back here later and look them up.

Look up 'bell curve' or 'normal distribution'. A picture is <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*IdGgdrY_n_9_YfkaCh-dag.png">here</a>. The formula is:
</p>

<p>
\(f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} 
  \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{\!2}\,\right)\)
</p>

<p>
or equivalent e<sup>x</sup> notation:
</p>

<p>
\(f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}\)
</p>

<p>
C = \(\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\), k = -1/2, and x is being shifted by h = \(\mu\)
</p>

<p>
Type this into <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fbfuefp9tl">desmos</a> and move the slider around. Notice parameter h, (here it's mu or \(\mu\)), the horizontal shift, determines the middle of the bell curve, in other words the mean. Parameter C, the y-intercept moves up and down the y-axis as you change it. Parameter k, when h is negative, k is positive, since -1/2 * -2 is 1, so all x inputs that are negative are concave up or climbing, and all positive x inputs are negative concaving down to give the bell curve. Everything else like squaring the inputs, dividing by C (here the standard deviation), is finessing of the data to construct that model you can play around with too in desmos to see how it works.

This is the setup for understanding log(). Can quickly skim this chapter: horizontal line test, montononic functions have inverses, find the inverse by inputting the y output and getting original x input, etc. I don't really get what the chapter refers to as 'book keeping convention of change of variables', example 9 if you want an inverse function to y = 4x - 7 then x = 0.25y + 1.75 is what you want instead of y = 0.25x + 1.75 because then you are solving for x all over again if 2 = 0.25x + 1.75 instead of x = 0.25(2) + 1.75, and the whole point was to reverse y and get the original f(x) inputs. Maybe this is explained in future chapters.

There's some easy examples substituting log rules for each other, these come up all the time in solving recurrence relations in algorithm/discrete math courses.
</p>

<p>
Let's try question 5: find the equation of the exponential function passing through points (0,-4) and (3,-24). Stare at the laws of logarithms and reduce/substitute:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>y = Ce<sup>kx</sup>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>-24 = -4e<sup>3k</sup></li>
<li>6 = e<sup>3k</sup></li>
<li>ln(6) = ln(e<sup>3k</sup>)</li>
<li>ln(6) = 3k
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>6 can't be manipulated into one of the log laws</li>
</ul></li>
<li>k = ln(6)/3
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>y = -4e<sup>\(\frac{ln(6)}{3}x\)</sup></li>

<p>
Graph it with <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wy5qhwilsp">desmos</a> here I added a second graph to play around with h parameter. Skim the semi-log and log-log plots material then you can safely skip to the end of chapter summary. The exercises again take a random sampling if you feel like it, you don't have to memorize all the laws of logarithms just be aware they exist, and you can come back to this chapter later to manipulate them as per log laws when you encounter them. As usual Ex 97-102 are the best where you have to explain yourself the chapter material like C is the magnitude parameter, h is the horizontal shift.

<p>
There's errata in the book chapter, Example 3 is filled with errors, should be 3pi/4 = 135deg not 5pi/4 which is 225deg. It then mixes up the signs for 5pi/4 with 3pi/4 but looking at Figure 5 you can figure out what the correct example should be.

<li>2 is \((\sqrt 2)^2\) or \(\sqrt 2 \cdot \sqrt 2\) since \(\sqrt 4\) = 2</li>
</ul>

<p>
The book provides trig identities that we learned in the Brown bootcamp, and really that's it, the exercises primarily are plug and play or graphing functions on desmos or in R to see how the identities work, which for the most part the lockdown math lecture already provided for us.

Wildberger has an ancient trig lecture <a href="https://youtu.be/Eijwgi8rCRg">here</a> (22m) on 4000 year old Babylonian surveying, apparently trig originates from land taxation and ownership disputes even before they wanted to start building pyramids and ziggurats and was an offshoot of ancient people who wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/yFMcNXC-dW0">map stars</a> and predict eclipses.

This <a href="https://youtu.be/5PcpBw5Hbwo">workshop</a> is part 2 of trig fundamentals and is optional, we finished the first section of the book which is 105 pages in 7 days and are now on to section 2 <i>Mathematical Modeling</i> but this workshop will further explain trig identities. Alternatively, the Wildberger rational trigonometry lectures also contain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7NDSPtoVP0">complex numbers</a> defined as dilations (stretch) and rotations. His later <a href="https://youtu.be/XoTeTHSQSMU">complex number</a> lectures make the concept of i<sup>2</sup> = -1 trivial, he defines i as a 2x2 matrix that when multiplied by itself produces -1.   
</p>

<p>
If you're confused watching the lockdown math lecture, the Geogebra visualization at around 30:55 emphasizes how everything stretches and rotates. The quiz @45:53 is a trig identity, cos(pi/6 + pi/4) or cos(α + β) = cos(α)cos(β) – sin(α)sin(β) all the inputs are in figure 5 on page 111 and he derives it from complex number multiplication. @1:09:09 the quiz solution is obvious if you again look at figure 5 on page 111.

<p>
Since we are going to rapidly do the math modeling section of the book, we have some extra time, so may as well watch the next lockdown math lecture about e<sup>ix</sup> since it provides a model of sin/cos functions as a weighted sum of the exponential function and teaches the properties of exp() we will have to learn later anyway.   
</p>

<p>
Watching lockdown math <a href="https://youtu.be/ZxYOEwM6Wbk">workshop 4</a> <i>What is Euler's formula actually saying?</i>. We learn e<sup>x</sup> is really exp(x) and all the parameters still apply like C(exp(kx)). @16:24 the first quiz, reminder that if f(a+b) = f(a)f(b) then we have the rules of exponents, since 2<sup>3</sup> \(\cdot\) 2<sup>4</sup> = 2<sup>7</sup> and 2<sup>7</sup> = 2<sup>3+4</sup>, so every option in the quiz is true though he has a moment of confusion that ends up being 1/e * e or e/e which is 1 and still satisfies exp(-1 + 1) = exp(0) = 1.
</p>

<p>
Quiz @ 27:30 is a Khan Academy <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:complex/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:imaginary/a/powers-of-the-imaginary-unit">lesson</a> but his geometric explanation you can easily see it is -i.
</p>

<p>
Try it yourself: i<sup>-1</sup> = 1/i
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1/i = i<sup>4</sup>/i because if i<sup>2</sup> = (-1) then i<sup>2</sup> \(\cdot\) i<sup>2</sup> = 1 which is 1/i</li>
<li>1/i = i<sup>3</sup> because i<sup>4</sup>/i is i<sup>3</sup></li>
<li>1/i = i<sup>3</sup> = (i<sup>2</sup> \(\cdot\) i) or ((-1) \(\cdot\) i) which = -i.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Summary: \(\frac{1}{i} = \frac{i^4}{i} = i^3 = (i^2 \cdot i) = (-1 \cdot i) = -i\) 
</p>

<p>
When he shows the visualization of exp(i(theta)): i moves up, i<sup>2</sup> is -1 so moves left, i<sup>3</sup> is -i so moves down..the @40m quiz asking what is e<sup>3i</sup>, we can rewrite this as exp(i(3)) and besides him already showing us roughly what this value is @38:40 where theta = pi, recall figure 5 on page 111 of our book and see that pi on the unit circle is -1, so since e<sup>3i</sup> is close to e<sup>3.14..i</sup> it's going to be a slightly positive i and nearly -1 value for x. Of course this is also cos(3) + i(sin(3)).   
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework 1</b>: expand exp(x)exp(y) or e<sup>x</sup>e<sup>y</sup> or e<sup>x + y</sup> and show every term has a form of \(\frac{x^{k}y^{m}}{k!m!}\)
</p>

<p>
The formula for exp() is:
</p>

<p>
\[exp(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{k!} = \frac{x^0}{0!} + \frac{x^1}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} ..\]
</p>

<p>
Recall the lecture on <a href="#Summation%2Fseries%20notation">Summation/series notation</a>. So what is exp(1)exp(2), since this is ee<sup>2</sup> it should be e<sup>1+2</sup> we will cut off at 2 though in practice you would never do this as you need numerous entries in the series for precision:
</p>

<p>
\[exp(1) = \sum_{k=0}^{2} \frac{1^k}{k!} = \frac{1^0}{0!} + \frac{1^1}{1!} + \frac{1^2}{2!}\]
\[exp(2) = \sum_{k=0}^{2} \frac{2^k}{k!} = \frac{2^0}{0!} + \frac{2^1}{1!} + \frac{2^2}{2!}\]
</p>

<p>
Now show every term is actually \(\frac{x^{k}y^{m}}{k!m!}\) for exp(1) \(\cdot\) exp(2):
</p>

<p>
\[(\frac{1^0}{0!} + \frac{1^1}{1!} + \frac{1^2}{2!})(\frac{2^0}{0!} + \frac{2^1}{1!} + \frac{2^2}{2!})\]
</p>

<p>
You're done, this shows each term as \(\frac{x^{k}y^{m}}{k!m!}\) after you FOIL everything out and collect them under similar denominators at least, I think that's what he's asking.  
</p>

<p>
Homework 2 requires remembering the binomial theorem or <a href="https://youtu.be/V2mk24udsMw">n choose k</a>, and #3 is to compare both results to convince yourself that exp(x + y) is roughly exp(x)exp(y) because exp(x) ~ e<sup>x</sup> so exp() should act like an exponent with the same laws. Homework 4 req watching his linear algebra playlist, and everywhere exists <a href="https://secure.math.ubc.ca/~feldman/m267/complex.pdf">notes</a> or youtube tutorials on the complex exponental: exp(iy) = 1 + iy + (iy)<sup>2</sup>/2!&#x2026; where all the positive terms become cos() and negative terms become i(sin()) since i<sup>2</sup> = -1 and i<sup>3</sup> = -i etc. Basically you end up proving the thumbnail in this lecture if you try it.
</p>

<p>
The exp(x) for matrices is explained in the next lecture @59:08 if you're curious. Matrices don't commute when you multiply them.

<p>
A last and optional <a href="https://youtu.be/IAEASE5GjdI">workshop</a> on e<sup>x</sup> introduces the limit definition of e<sup>x</sup>. Reminder imaginary i is \(\sqrt{-1}\). I chose this because you get an intuitive definition of limits, change and continuous math, plus a crash course in acceleration. All central topics in calculus. The question @43:50 'x nought' or x<sub>0</sub>, all this means is an arbitrary distance, so instead of inserting a concrete distance of say 12, you abstract this to say it's x<sub>0</sub> because the actual value doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
I also liked this lecture because he substitutes a lot of equations to make them simpler, such as assigning a complex expression to z, or change in z = -1 * z * change in t. In the other math workshop, the Putnam seminar repeatedly uses this strategy to assist with proofs and simplify them.

How do we know if data fits a linear model? Check the slopes are approximately similar at different points, y/x or rise/run, take the average of the slopes minus the one you couldn't include since you don't know the y4 - y3 value if only given data up to y3. Once you get the slope iterate through all y points to solve for b, reminder b is the shift up and down the y-axis, average these and now you have y = mx + b with m and b known and can plug in all your data.

<p>
We verify if exponential models are a reasonable data fit by plotting it (x, ln(y)) which produces a linear straight line if e<sup>x</sup> is the model that fits the data, otherwise we get a curved (non-linear) line. I interpret 'nonconstant' linear meaning you have a variable in there that changes, and not just a constant like y = 5 or else you get a linear flat line no matter what.
</p>

<p>
Page 142 there's a good breakdown why this works:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ln(y) = kx + (-kh + ln(C))</li>
<li>this is of course y = mx + (b) since k is the slope</li>
</ul>

<p>
Should this test for linearity using ln(x) work, our semi-log model of y = m(x - h) + b gives us the parameters for the exponential model where m = k (slope), and C = e<sup>b</sup>, so e<sup>be</sup><sup>kx</sup>. There's a remark that if you're dealing with -C parameter, you take the absolute value and see if it's linear since ln(x) it's domain is the positive real numbers, so ln(-C) is undefined. I skimmed the rest of the chapter, good advice here how to shift the data to fit the model using the h parameter. If I need this model I'll return to this chapter later.

Power functions are y = Cx<sup>k</sup> where k and C are constants. Example: y = x is a power function: y = 1x<sup>1</sup> or Cx<sup>k</sup>. 
</p>

<p>
Many of the examples here reinforce the laws of exponents, showing you how to manipulate power function equations. The test for identifying a power function model fits the data is to take the log-log plot or (ln(x), ln(y)) and the result should be approximately linear. They again show reasoning in steps why this works on page 164, the last line being ln(y) = kln(x) + ln(C) and again this is y = mx + b. This test fails however if the input or output to ln() function are negative values, we can't just take the absolute value like we did with exponential models, and are told we're screwed and the solution is beyond the scope of the book. Chapter ends talking about logarithmic scale plots, where spacing between values on the x/y axis changes logarithmically, so you can show bigger inputs/outputs on smaller graphs.

'Dimensionaless' means a scalar, or c<sup>1</sup> like 1, 2, 3. The number line is 1-dimensional, cartesian (x,y) plane is 2-dimensional, 3-dimensions is (x,y,z) etc. 
</p>

<p>
This whole chapter is about combining dimensions to get a new dimensional result, not the concrete values. Example 3(a): 55mph is the product of either LT<sup>-1</sup> where T=1 for 1 hour, then L*1*0.5 is the answer or T = 60m then 55/60*30 to get the same answer, which is a distance dimension. Using purely dimensional arithmetic, you get LT<sup>-1</sup>T which is just L, the distance travelled and same dimension we ended up using concrete values.
</p>

<p>
Ex 4(a): 4bc where b=T and c=LT<sup>-1</sup> the 4 being a scalar becomes 1 because we are working at the dimensional level, and the answer is L since LTT<sup>-1</sup> is LT/T or L*1. 
</p>

<p>
Since we are just working at the level of exponents, they have the same arithmetic as vectors do. This chapter's content on solving three linear equations for three unknown exponents is a simple linear algebra problem we will learn in the next section.
</p>

<p>
You can skip most of this chapter and come back later as needed, however after reading this chapter and reminding myself on basic dimensional analysis I forgot years ago, I started to notice it is absolutely everywhere even in type theory for dimensional correctness type checking, and statistics theory books to reduce the number of causal factors under consideration and test for scalar dimensionaless quantities.

dy/dx or d/dx consumes functions like p(x) = x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 5 and returns a new function p'(x) = 2x + 3 even when we only have a constant returned, such as d(2x) = 2 then what that really means is d(2x) returns p'(x) = 2 a function that returns 2 for all inputs x.

</ul>

<p>
Wildberger has another interpretation of calculus called the algebraic calculus, here he goes through (starting around 6:45) how you would go about defining your own integration formula. Around 7m in he starts at the beginning integrating a constant x<sup>0</sup> or 1, a variable x<sup>1</sup>, a quadratic x<sup>2</sup>, and points out Archimedes already figured this out over 2200+ years ago in Italy with an extremely simple method.

Around 14m is the standard integration explanation we get in every course. @24:57 we go from Archimedes to the 17th century to see what happens when we integrate x<sup>3</sup> using the standard x<sup>n</sup> integration formula. Around 29m in he outlines some problems with integration theory like the nature of the continuum, the problems of using arithmetical series instead of a geometric series, and having no theory of area. This is classic Wildberger hating on analytic modern mathematicians but 34:20 is worth watching, the 'absent theory of areas'.

</ul>

<p>
Here he goes through all the difference approaches you could try if you were to think up your own integral formula. The most important of this video is the basic integral properties of linearity, additivity, translation invariance, scale invariance and normalization. He walks through all these properties then shows a full proof of the x<sup>n</sup> integral using just those properties completely in basic algebra.

You know enough to work through any AI undergrad <a href="./ai.html">statistics</a> or learn how to write <a href="./math.html">proofs</a> and will likely return to this book many times as you work through Wasserman's <i>All of Statistics</i> or even a book on algorithm design.

Let's work through <i>Advanced Problems in Mathematics: Preparing for University</i> by Siklos. It's a <a href="https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/1050">free and open</a> text. This is the best way to fill in any blanks, these kinds of problems are designed so you learn multiple concepts at once.

<p>
We are also doing this for time efficiency, you can get up in the morning, load up a problem in your head, poke at it over a coffee then hold it in your head for the rest of the day trying to figure it out when you have some downtime like waiting in a line, going for lunch, sitting on the subway. It will annoy you if you can't figure it out and force you to do independent research going through calculus texts trying to find solutions, re-reading all the sections we skipped or you didn't fully understand the first time around.
