Basically for clickbait title reasons, We do the work by hand and the rest using the R programming language which the book will teach you, consider it an advanced calculator we aren't doing any programming though if you wanted to learn programming, do <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/software.html">this</a> at the same time. If you learn programming then this will be easy, multivariable functions and higher-order functions are taught there which will frequently come up in calculus: take derivative of a function, get another function returned.

I have a math workshop <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/math.html">here</a> with olympiad/putnam style challenges instead of going through books in a linear way and forcing yourself to finish them which will eventually cover the same thing but it's a different style: you get up and look at (often very difficult) problem, write a list of possible solution strategies on paper, research for a few minutes then go about your day annoyed you can't solve this problem with it in the back of your mind until you get home later and either look at the solution or have figured out the solution.

I too once had to google 'How to learn calculus' and received the worst possible advice. There are countless MOOCs, books, MIT Open CourseWare with full lectures and assignments, and often confusing math stack exchange and blog posts that cover exactly what we are doing but most people including myself give up either as soon as the run into a difficult wall and can't figure out something that is poorly explained, or from lack of interest. Ergo I am slightly gamifying this material by days I do it, sort of a 'this guy did it so anybody can' kind of manipulative strategy. Not chapters but days completed.  
</p>

<p>
Here are the books you will find when googling 'I need to learn Calculus':   
</p>

<details id="orgb68218b">
<p>
Spivak <i>Calculus</i> is an introduction to analysis written for highly motivated highschool students who have never had a pure math course. Real analysis is taking tiny measurements of the real line and writing slightly suspicious proofs about them with the Archimedean property and other axioms. A professor writes about why he doesn't exclusively teach from Spivak in the interesting foreward <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.475.4296&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">here</a> because many blanks needed to be filled in and his office hours were overflowing with help requests. He recommends it for anybody with a recent and solid highschool background who are self-studying on their own out of curiousity and want to learn only single variable analysis. If this is you then disregard my advice and read Spivak and come back when you need to learn how to model and use the tools of multivariable/differential calculus. 
</p>

<p>
Apostol <i>Calculus I &amp; II</i> I own this book, the international version from Abe Books is only $25 and I credit this book for helping me finally 'get' math by slogging through all the tedious end of chapter problems that seem to be filled with random trig identities because if Apostol doesn't have anything meaningful to add to the chapter, he will drill you on the identities for whatever reason. This is written in a similar style to all uppergrad style books meaning defintion/theorem/proof style and because it was originally published in a time where highschool was even worse than now, Apostol will build up everything from scratch like defining a linear space before introducing linear algebra basics, teaching you trig, teaching all notation etc. However it is a significant amount of work, if you have a shaky background like me it will take about a year to finish the first volume by yourself. This is something you can do <i>after</i> doing an intro calc course sequence like this workshop, if you don't have previous exposure to this kind of math you can spend an entire week or longer on a single page. Many of his proofs I couldn't understand either and had to use Terence Tao's <i>Analysis I</i> book to understand them as they were too abstract. That said if you're going to buy a calculus book, you may want to buy these two Apostol books.
</p>

<p>
Stewart <i>Calculus Early Transcendentals</i> is probably what your university/college is going to use because there's a new edition every single year where they rearrange the problems, and add more junk inflating the page count, then make countless students buy a copy for $200+. If you want a problem book, do Shaum's <i>Outline of Calculus</i> instead which is $10 or free from library genesis. and avoid this book at all cost. Everything in this book is magically perfect inputs and cherry picked examples. It will not teach you how to actually use calculus which consists of gnarly inequalities that need solving. 
</p>

<p>
Strang <i>Calculus</i> which is free <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/">here</a> from MIT (terrible copy, buy a 3rd edition copy from his <a href="http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/">publisher</a>) is one of the most useful applied calculus books, written by an applied mathematician. I didn't include it because the digital copies are all trash and it assumes a background, but if you don't mind then this is the most efficient calc book out there he explains what calculus is in the first page then the rest of the book is more or less applications and he has a YouTube series 'highlights of calculus'. tl;dr I like this book, the digital copies are all awful and I found the math modelling w/applied calc book better for later learning probability and statistics anyway so went with that.
</p>

<p>
Thomas <i>Calculus</i> stopped being good after the 4th edition. I own the 3rd edition from the 1960s and it's completely different compared to the terribad garbage rewrites that happened after George Thomas died and the publisher cashed out with a hundred versions all watered down many of them directly published for certain university semesters. The 8th edition off library genesis is OK but you may as well just do Simmon's calc book if you want a long analytical geometry style text. Don Knuth used Thomas' classic edition which you can buy <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780201077797">here</a> and he credits doing all the supplementary problems in the back of the text with helping him learn math, he claims from this practice he could coast the rest of his college career in many interviews but he was forced to do this out of fear of failing calculus at his university. We have no such motivations so probably you will just abandon the book like most self-studying students.
</p>

<p>
MIT's Open Courseware calculus courses <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/">here</a> is often suggested because all the lectures are included and the assignments/recitations. These are great if you already have an excellent math background because you wouldn't get into MIT otherwise. We may do a few of them, I've watched the single variable lectures and prof often will do algebra manipulations assuming the audience knows what he's doing (because they do, they got into MIT) which brings us to the next section, basic review of fundamentals.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-How%20the%20US%20olympiad%20coach%20teaches%20problem%20solving">
<p>
Let's watch an example of how the current US Olympiad coach Poh-Shen Loh figures out a problem: click <a href="https://youtu.be/vGQZjITDft4?t=1890">here</a> and skip to 31:30 to start CMU's Putnam competition seminar. We're starting with question 3: The polynomial p(x) has all integral (meaning an integer) coefficients. The leading coefficient, the constant term, and p(1) are all odd. Show that p(x) has no rational roots. A root means it has a zero, or you can take the whole polynomial, move everything to the left side, and equate it to zero and solve. We learn this in the <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/math.html#Algebra%202%20Polynomials">math</a> workshop using a Russian olympiad book. 
</p>

<p>
A polynomial recall from highschool looks like p(x) = 5x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 1 or at a more abstract level, it's many monomials like \(x^n\) grouped together with addition/subtraction/multiplication/division in other words algebra, and a constant like 5 or 1 is also a monomial too since 5x<sup>0</sup> or 1x<sup>0</sup>, the zero exponent by rules of exponents is substituted for 1, so really this is 5(1) or 6(1) because no matter what you substitute for x, it will be 1 anyway since the exponent is zero. Why do they exist? Because they are a convenient abstraction. Where did I learn the laws of exponents? Google or read Terence Tao's chapter on them <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/math.html#4.3%20Absolute%20value%20and%20exponentiation">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
@32:00 notice he asks for tiny, tiny ideas. You are a detective trying to figure something out, and just throwing out ideas and writing them down. Reminder the 'coefficient' in 5x is 5. @35:00 or so he comes up with a possible strategy: eliminate the odds, eliminate the evens, now you've removed any possible of being an integer ergo it's not rational because of the above Wildberger lectures where a rational number is constructed from integers.
</p>

<p>
@37:00 he uses the term 'implies'. What does this mean? This is mathematical logic you can read <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/MartinLofOnTheMeaning96.pdf">here</a> a very good paper by Swiss logician and type theorist Per-Martin Lof on the justifications of all these terms like implies, conjuction, disjunction, what a proposition is etc. It's probably the best paper around that explains this logic to a general audience but is advanced enough you will come away from it able to write a proof and verify what you wrote is correct using logical judgements. This is also the only paper I've ever read which spells out exactly what a proof is and helped me to understand the Agda proof-assistant <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/747/notes/index.html">book</a>. Conjuction is a product, disjunction is a sum.
</p>

<p>
Watch the rest of this seminar, this is how you do problems. It's an investigation and playing around until the answer reveals itself. I already watched it <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/math.html#Lecture%201%20Introduction">here</a> and explain how he cleared the fractions if you're confused.

Reading Chapter 1 of <i>Mathematical Modeling and Applied Calculus</i>. Skim this chapter it probably contains things you don't remember. You can always jump to the end of chapter exercises and try enough of them to justify skipping this chapter but this is a different book than most math texts and often has important things to point out that we will come across in later chapters.
</p>

<p>
In case you forgot highschool and the <a href="https://youtu.be/a6Pk-kbzhxA">Cartesian plane</a>, the inputs are the horizontal line and outputs are the points on the veritcal axis. All this does is conveniently represent an input/output relationship with a visualization of displacements.
</p>

<p>
We are also introduced to our first math <a href="https://youtu.be/zrt0EKuGr5Q">data structure</a>, a tuple or an ordered pair of values enclosed in brackets like (1, 2). This is similar to the idea of a list in programming, somebody needed a way to represent values in math in which the order matters and duplicates could be possible like (3, 3), so invented a tuple structure.
</p>

<p>
Page 8: Question 2: obviously (c) and (b) have numerous y outputs for a single x input. The definition on the same page claims 'every function in this book is contained in the real numbers' which you can read about in the math workshop if you're interested. Rationals, integers and natural numbers are all contained in the real numbers but <a href="https://youtu.be/XoTeTHSQSMU">complex numbers</a> or whatever other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_numbers#Non-standard_numbers">number object</a> abstractions aren't.
</p>

<p>
Example 4(c), they throw in set theory notation (union) without defining it. If you're interested <a href="https://youtu.be/59WX2V7Vjgg">watch</a> a lecture on sets and functions. They also use interval notation without defining it which you can search for on YouTube yourself.
</p>

<p>
Question 4: Identify the domain of each function. (a) clearly can be anything, (b) can be any negative number, since 4 - (-4) is 8, and 0, 1, 2, 3 to avoid being a negative square root, so (-inf, 4) if we are using interval bracket notation to exclude 4. (c) every single input maps to the same output, so it's domain is the entire 'real numbers'.
</p>

<p>
Example 5 is much easier if you include brackets f(x) = \((3)\sqrt{x} - 5\) now you know exactly what to do, take the square root of x and multiply it by 3 and subtract 5. Anytime you see math notation jumbled together like this it means multiplication but brackets are never included for some reason.

<div id="outline-container-R%20Studio" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="R%20Studio">R Studio</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-R%20Studio">
<p>
Reminder we are just using RStudio as a glorified calculator, you don't need to know how to program and can easily figure this out yourself. The <i>working in R studio</i> aside you can do this <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/">online</a> instead of having to install anything locally if all you have is a phone, meaning work in your browser if you want. The instructions are in the appendix, make a throwaway gmail account, open new project on r studio, first thing you type:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga8575ef">
install.packages(c("MMAC", "mosaic", "mosaicCalc", "manipulate"))
</pre>

<p>
The 'c()' is a "vector" meaning multiple inputs to the install.packages() command. This command is actually install.packages(c) where c is filled with entries. Then you have to include all these libraries as written in require statements in the aside on page 12:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org47a55cd">
require(MMAC)
require(mosaic)
require(mosaicCalc)
require(manipulate)
</pre>

<p>
Then you have to paste in those require() statements to let the program know where to look to use those built-in functions like 'mosaic'. These libraries 'MMAC..mosaic.. mosaicCalc' etc are all data sets the book uses in later chapters we will import and then model. 
</p>

<p>
I rewrote <i>Example 7(d)</i> to make it more clear:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org9dee0a7">
abs( (2^3 / 4^5) - (9^8 / 6^7) )
</pre>

<p>
I'm not sure why they use (2<sup>3</sup>)/(4<sup>5</sup>) style brackets but whatever, either works. I also rewrote the aside on page 13 from f=makeFun(8*x+4~x) to the following to make it more clear:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org32b3bc3">
&gt; f = makeFun( ((8 * x) + 4) ~x)
&gt; f(3)
[1] 28
</pre>

<p>
And I rewrote the plotFun example:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd8a4302">
plotFun( ((-4 * x) +8)~x,xlim=range(-5,5) )
</pre>

<p>
Which gives you a nice graph on the right hand side of Rstudio.
</p>

<p>
<b>Question 9</b> Graph a line with a specific domain in RStudio:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgb3ba775">
&gt; line = makeFun(((-3.546 * x) - 9.128)~x)
&gt; plotFun(line(x)~x, xlim=range(-15,15))

Try experimenting with syntax, this seemed to work too because we already declared line a function with (x) input:

&gt; plotFun(line, xlim=range(-15,15))
</pre>

You learn basic algebra by doing the exercises, so try some. There is 100 exercises(!). The only non-functions I see in Ex 7-14 are 10, 13 and 14 because the same input has different outputs (3.14 is not the same object that pi is). All of these you can answer in your head in a couple of seconds. 
</p>

<p>
Ex 34 recall is \(\sqrt{x}\) + \((4\cdot\sqrt{1 + x})\). We can't have a negative square root so you have take into account \(\sqrt{x}\) meaning the domain is the entire positive real numbers and zero. You can rewrite this to x<sup>1/2</sup> + 4(x + 1)<sup>1/2</sup> because of rational <a href="https://www.mesacc.edu/~scotz47781/mat120/notes/exponents/rational/rational_exponents.html">exponent rules</a>, x<sup>m/n</sup> = \(n \cdot \sqrt{x^m}\)
</p>

<p>
Try changing all these exercises to an equivalent form from the Wildberger basic arithmetic lectures in the beginning of this workshop. For example Ex 37 can be rewritten \(\frac{\pi}{x^2 - 9} \cdot \frac{x}{x}\) and now it's obvious you can cancel one of the x's to simplify this problem to a domain that avoids x<sup>2</sup> - 9 being negative.
</p>

<p>
Ex 35 we only care that the denominator is not 0, since a/b + c/d = ad/bd + cb/bd then the denominator is 4x<sup>2</sup> + 20x or 4x(x + 5) and x can't be -5, or else we get 4x(0) which is 0 or -20(-5 + 5) which is 100 - 100 or 0.
</p>

<p>
Every other exercise is straight forward plug-in and solve, but I like exercises 91 to 100 where you have to in your own words explain all the topics the chapter presented. This is known as the <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/11/25/the-feynman-notebook-method/">Feynman method</a> where you attempt to explain concepts to an invisible audience in the most simplest terms anybody can understand, and if you find yourself stumbling or failing to remember then you go back and reread those concepts until you can effortlessly explain 91 through 100. I easily passed them all except the 'modeling cycle' which tripped me up and I had to go back and re-read it again. When you explain it, remove any words like 'conjecture' or even 'data'. Imagine somebody is sitting in front of you asking you to define every word you use, and wants to know exactly what 'data' means (tip: they do this in those annoying software developer interviews)
</p>

<p>
It took me about an hour to do 100 exercises for Chapter 1 so congrats, you're done for today
