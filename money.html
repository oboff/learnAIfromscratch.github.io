If you search there is lot's of answers to 'how do I learn to program' but not many practical answers to 'how do I make money programming' that don't include trying to do interviews and be an employee. Here we will actually freelance it up for fame and fortune starting with no background, and presumably working a F/T job already in some industry totally different than writing software.

Russian language social media has a movement "вкaтитьcя в aйти" translated "get into the IT sphere" as a way to change careers and escape low salaries there, which is exactly what I did about 9 years ago so I will see if it's still possible to do here in this workshop.

<a href="https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/">Fly.io</a> free tier gives you 3GB persistent storage, 160GB/month outbound bandwidth, and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> certs. It's a 'serverless' hosting scheme where you write an app and deploy it as is, or shove your app into a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> container, and they run it on their global content delivery network. This can be completely automated too. Translated this means we can write customized software for businesses (people who will pay us) and it's turn-key, we can extract out the generic parts of software, make it into our own template to customize to punters for cash or sell it as is.

Web or distributed computing software is now so vast that I decided to target the most abstract frameworks possible which presently is <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> (Elixir language) and launch our software for free on fly.io which runs like fire as they managed to get the Phoenix creator to set it up. We can build and launch a crazy real-time web application with thousands of concurrent users interacting like an auction site or a whatsapp clone, a server for a phone app, a server for a multiplayer game that runs on desktops, bots, sell plugins in software stores like Shopify or GSuite, some kind of personal firewall, anything. Look at <a href="https://www.dealdash.com/">dealdash</a> that's a Phoenix site, yes you can build this yourself.

We have to learn Elixir, a functional language which compiles bytecode to run in the Erlang BEAM virtual machine, and understand it's run-time system. Pattern matching is a common idiom in Elixir programming so we need to learn it, and Elixir's dynamics how expressions are evaluated and run, plus it's type system. Elixir simplifies complexity by breaking up programs into modules, so we need to know modules. We need to know all the developer tooling like generating tests and documentation automatically and common editor plugins like Dialyzer a code analysis tool. We have to learn all the weird abstractions of the OTP behavior modules like actor models and supervision trees which means we need to also learn trees in general. We have to learn software and data design, how do we know our ideas will work and how do we translate it into software that isn't trash. Finally we have to learn how to sell our software or sell ourselves as contractors.. and of course we have to know what we don't know which will come as we go, but no problem.

It's worth writing down the definition of a concept:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>purpose: what is the concept for? (one purpose for one concept)</li>
<li>structure: what is the essential data model?</li>
<li>actions: what actions define the behavior? (implementation using basic function signatures)</li>
<li>operational principal: how is this expected to be used? what is the archetypal scenario?</li>

Watching <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZ85ui0k2QpCKgfJZXUPSk-jdSi36MzP/view">Conceptual Design 2</a>. Can you look at the concept and know immediately if that concept is going to work or not before going on to waste your time writing software? "Write down each purpose, make sure each purpose gets it's own concept". He goes through many examples to further explain conceptual design such as the confusion of Gmail's categories vs labels is examined as a design rule violation, spreadsheet software problems, git problems, dropbox non-uniform behavior.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What makes a usable concept?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One-to-one rule: each concept should have one purpose
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>overloading concepts with multiple purposes leads to confusion like the gmail labels/categories</li>
<li>a second purpose needs a second concept</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Uniformity: operational principle is uniform
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>always the same actions irrespective of context unless it would make no sense (example: attaching sent labels to messages you haven't actually sent)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Genericity: reuse familiar concepts instead of inventing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>strange new concept of sections in Powerpoint instead of just a familiar file folder concept used by Keynote</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

As an example of this design method the prof and one of his phd students redesigned git into <a href="https://gitless.com/">gitless</a>. As a concrete example of using this procedure to design Hacker News, see <a href="https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/4415/pages/tuesday-10-slash-13-concept-design-rules?module_item_id=146785">these slides</a> on page 7 and 8.

Watching <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qblmdoZIJQ4rYGgCPLNusEn2yWiq1cxy/view">UX Design &amp; Heuristics I</a> the first 50m are examples of learnability, security, and other design criteria by analyzing a Korean subway turnstile design. The end of the lecture talks about grouping similar things together visually using Google actions as an example that violates this property. One way to do user studies is find software similar to what you plan on designing, and read all the negative reviews, or the feature requests picking out design flaws. For example 'Gunbot' a trading bot uses github issues for feature requests, and many issues are <a href="https://github.com/GuntharDeNiro/GunbotAMA/issues/95">design problems</a>. If you were making your own trading bot, you'd want to go through that list of issues during the conceptual design phase, not that you'd be able to implement all the features of mature software but at least could be aware of them and design for future features you'd want to include.

Most of this is in the above <a href="https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/4415/files/804925?module_item_id=195040">usability cheat sheet</a> the idea being that whatever your service design you go through the heuristics and prove to yourself they are satisfied.

These <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa19/6.170/courseMaterial/topics/topic3/lectureNotes/10_-_html:css:dom/10_-_html:css:dom.pdf">slides</a> are well designed, explaining the basics. If you right-click on any website and inspect the content, you'll see piles of nested div elements so the CSS style sheets can select them and give style rules for that div box. This is considered bad style since anyone using a screen reader will have no idea what's going on without the new HTML tags like &lt;article&gt; but of course you can design it however you want. Our HTML will be generated if you use Phoenix webserver, and we'll use some CSS framework like Tailwind or something.  
</p>

<p>
CSS try <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">https://flukeout.github.io/</a> to crash course yourself on selectors. There's also <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">flexbox</a> training and <a href="https://cssgridgarden.com/">grid</a> training, you're placing a mapping over the page and flexbox allows you to group them in a single line to fit every screen size (like a menu bar at top of page with multiple items) or grid which allows you to group them on multiple lines. Then your website is 'responsive' reacting to changes in screen size. 
</p>

<p>
If you really want to dig deep into CSS and learn it, then see HW Lie's <a href="https://www.wiumlie.no/2006/phd/">thesis</a> understanding all the concepts there, then move up to CSS standards. Learn it in stages from the first spec to the most recent. If you read the thesis you'll see the original plan for CSS was that everyone would have their own style sheets to overrides the website default. In practice no user makes their own CSS because it's way too complicated and sites change too much but that is where the idea of 'the cascade' came from this priority of which CSS sheet to use.    
</p>

<p>
To make it even more confusing you have to refer to sites such as <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-grid">can I use</a> to see what browser versions support what CSS or HTML features. For example Internet Explorer still doesn't support CSS Grid fully. 
</p>

<p>
The Document-Object-Model (DOM) is what you think it is, a tree that models the html elements and you can manipulate it to only change certain things instead of reloading the html. For example you are entering info in a form and after each line a green checkmark appears beside that field, you could manipulate the dom to wait for that event and then trigger an action to change the tree and show the checkmark. The DOM has a standard you can look up to find all the edge cases like how error messages bubble up the tree much like exceptions in programming do that we will shortly learn.

<p>
This course so far has given us specific things to do that make the design of software much easier, and you already know a lot about application building without writing a single line of code.  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Conceptual Design</li>
</ul>

<p>
Come up with a purpose, for example AirBnB, you want to show pictures of the property. There are already existing concepts for this, look at the similarity between Vrbo property pictures and AirBnB. A large picture with 4 smaller ones, depending on screen size, and a 'show all photos' button. Look at Expedia listings for private vacation homes, exact same concept a large picture with 4 smaller ones and a 'show more' icon but their icon has more <i>information scent</i> telling you the total number of pictures. All 3 of these sites when you click on a picture give you all the photos on a single page. You would probably want to reuse this concept if you were making a generic site for landlords that want to buy your generic booking software instead of coming up with a new concept because users already know how to use it, and where to look for more pictures. You would break down this concept into show more photos, expand picture, all the functionality needed. You would then create a data model for this which we will soon learn. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Interface Heuristics</li>
</ul>

<p>
Going with the AirBnB example of creating a private site to book properties, while doing the wireframing you go through the usability cheat sheet we were given, making sure your design conforms. Things in context to each other should be nearby, recall the example of that Google app where upon selecting messages there is no indications what to do next, you have to move too far away from that context to select 'Actions'. You at all times want to present the user's current state to them, in the form of breadcrumbs or other information so they know where they are in your application. You absolutely want undo methods for everything.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>API and Data Design</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once we learn these, we are officially application developers and the easy part begins where all we have to do is implement it in code.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Data%20Design">
<p>
Abstract data design modeling is something I haven't seen anywhere else, it's a nice way to plan out exactly what data needs to be stored and the best way to make them into database tables without knowing any sql. It uses sets a datastructure in math we will pickup as we go.
</p>

<p>
Watching <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1axvYX7kSWAmxDU451hyCcG-wt880uVoe/view">Abstract Data Design I</a>. This lecture starts at 31:50 with seperation of concerns, if you're interested there's a security lecture before it about cross site req forgery attacks but we will learn all this in the context of Phoenix framework security which mitigates many common webapp attacks (and exposes new ones we have to learn).
</p>

<p>
@36:29 the cheat sheet is <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/courseMaterial/topics/topic1/studyMaterial/object-models-cheatsheet/data-models-cribsheet.pdf">here</a>. This is merely helpful notation to get you to think about how to represent the data model in a dbms. He absolutely blasted through some conjuction (union) and disjunction (intersection) notation, if you've never seen this kind of notation watch <a href="https://youtu.be/59WX2V7Vjgg">this</a>.
</p>

<p>
He walks through how to do this. Classify everything into sets. Try and break those sets into subsets. If you totally exhaust the parent set into subsets, italicize it's name. Identify what is immutable and what is dynamic, meaning if a set consists of several subsets, and you mark it immutable, it can only exist in one of those subsets not many at the same time. Relate atoms to the sets, such as indivisible addresses are related to messages, assign multiplicities such as how many from addresses can their be in a single message, the answer of course being one.
</p>

<p>
@46:21 the ? multiplicity means an object can only be in one folder so you can't have a distinct folder in two different folders at the same time, you could copy it but it would generate a new copy not have two different locations that when changed update a single location, that's all that ? means.

We will come back here when we design our first model, you don't have to fully understand everything yet. Of course we will using <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html">Ecto</a> to set up the dbms, create the schema and handle all queries, and we don't even have to set up Postgres or SQLite that's done for us as well.
</p>

<p>
Reminder atomic values means indivisible or scalar values, for example if taking addresses for an application and you want to store them, the street number is an atomic value, the street name an atomic value, first name, last name would be split into two fields of atomic string values, everything should be indivisible or map to a foreign key, which we will shortly learn.

Anything you want to know about a dbms can be learned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjbohkNBWQs_otTrBTrjyohi">here</a> from Andy Pavlo's Intro to Database Systems course like how obsessing about normal-forms is really a waste of time 'most people just wing it and end up in 3rd normal form'. We aren't doing this course, but some of it is helpful so you can understand foreign keys and the basic architecture. 
</p>

<p>
Watching the first <a href="https://youtu.be/oeYBdghaIjc?t=2209">lecture</a> skipping to ~36:49, starting with data models. @44:30 primary keys and examples of creating them. @45:00 foreign keys. His crash course on relational algebra, that's all you need to know about SQL. Select is a filter, Projection is show the data however you want like mapping over the attributes and adding 2 to each numerical entry and displaying the results in different order (this doesn't alter the original stored data). Intersection and 'Natural Join' are almost the same thing except you can have different table sizes for join whereas Union/Intersection operator must be done over two tables of exact same size. He goes through what exactly a join algorithm is <a href="https://youtu.be/nUwT7PEQ49o">here</a> if you're interested.
</p>

<p>
The observations @1:00:40 the database does all these optimizations for you so long as you have generic queries then when your data grows you don't have to go back and alter queries you wrote that were too specific like 'search this row for X, then join these two tables' instead you want 'join these two tables for X' and the dbms will figure out the most optimized way. If you watch the <i>Advanced SQL</i> lecture he talks about how common table expressions are the best optimization for the most use cases since you use a single SQL expression to tell the database what you want and it can then run it's global optimization schemes automatically on the whole query.

Your idea doesn't have to be web software, it can be a native binary running on a desktop and everything we just learned fully applies to that kind of software as well. Start with a minimal-viable product, can always add more features later.
</p>

<p>
Break everything into concepts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Purpose
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why would anybody want this functionality</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Operational Principal
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What are the typical ways this is used</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Concept
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The way we plan on implementing the purpose</li>
<li>Pref stolen from existing software unless a good reason to invent a new concept</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Structure
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The localized data model for just this concept</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Function stubs of actions we intend to create</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Create a localized data model for just that concept:    
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Classify sets of similar things</li>
<li>Divide into smaller subsets if possible
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Does this now exhaust the set</li>
<li>Is classification immutable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Draw relations between sets and the atoms they contain
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Are the relations immutable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Multiplicities: how many relations there are between a set and atoms</li>
</ul>

<p>
Combine all the concepts together, make a wireframe sketch:

I searched on some freelancer sites such as UpWork to find the most requested software: a direct booking site for a short-term property rental. I will make a special case of one of these Vrbo/AirBnB style booking sites, and extract out the generic functionality to be able to use as any kind of booking software such as barbershops, nail salons, condo strata booking the guest rooms, hiring cleaners, tattoo artist, anything where the purpose is to book a time block.
</p>

<p>
My plan is to just glue all the software people normally use/prefer together with my app in an automated magic way. If everyone is using iCalendar don't reinvent a calendar and force all your buyers to use it, export/import cleanly to iCalendar instead. If everyone is using NetSuite or Excel or SalesForce then make it simple to export directly. We don't want to spend forever designing accounting analytics when nobody will ever use it and instead want it imported to whatever they're already using. My software simply exists as a Swiss army knife there is already all the tools in the knife out there just nobody else is putting it together into a turnkey solution, and we're using Phoenix framework which gives us all kinds of live update abilities to do visual magic if we want.    
</p>

<p>
Let's research around to look at our competitors. The ads I've found so far on typical freelancer sites offering to build a booking site list all the frameworks they intend to use which the buyer probably doesn't care about, and they sell tiers of paid plugins for features. The software is priced for number of listings, probably because those paid plugins are priced like that too. They all hype search-engine optimization and the truth is Google and others will lower your rank the more SEO-junkified your page is now. The cleaner your site, the more text so not a single page app, the more likely you are going to get better search results in my experience right now but of course they change this criteria all the time so who knows what it will be next month. 
</p>

<p>
There exists numerous platforms called channel managers which sell the ability to sync all your ads on Booking, AirBnB, Vrbo, Expedia and all the other relevant sites. We don't have access to the APIs for AirBnB and other sites, meaning we can't directly sync availabilities or changes in price you have to pay for access through some partner they use, however we don't need access all we have to do is enable our software to be updated automatically by these channel managers. Most have an open API and we can copy some of the features, like rule based pricing.
</p>

<p>
There are hundreds of these small AirBnB sites run by realty companies, search for 'north carolina vacation rental' as an example. Many are violating all the usability tests we just learned. This <a href="https://www.carolinaretreats.com">site</a> has probably the best 'get my quote' checkout page of what I've found so far, a single page where all information is entered, forms and fees are clear and easy to read though I found some errors, like still asking for 'Zip' if you change country to UK. What's interesting is they can offer travel insurance directly at booking time through <a href="https://www.redskyinsurance.com/">this outfit</a>. These sites all seem to use the same common method of book online and pay nothing, then real payment and signatures are all done over email where an ESign doc is sent and then a Stripe gateway link or other for payment. The payment is rule based, taking a percentage during booking then only charging the card on the first day you stay there. 
</p>

<p>
Start by writing down purposes, here's mine for automated pricing:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Purpose
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be able to increase/decrease pricing over a range of dates</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Concept
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Two components: first is the amount to change the price (percentage or specific) second is the date/hour range it will change the price</li>
</ul></li>
<li>OP
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Select dates like holidays and weekends to increase or decrease the price automatically</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
We know from the MIT lecture that one purpose should map to a concept, so let's create a new concept   
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Purpose
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be able to set pricing based on the state of the booking calendar</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Concept
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Two components: first is the amount to change the price, second is the booking state to trigger the price change</li>
</ul></li>
<li>OP
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If there is an orphan period under X days in the calendar, offer a discount</li>
<li>Decrease prices by x amount per day for unfilled bookings y days before deadline</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Before I write the function stubs and a data model, recall the MIT lectures we watched this kind of small rule based policy is perfectly suited for modeling in Alloy and then running an instance to see what happens when many price rules collide with each other in ways we didn't anticipate. To complete the 'actions' part of our conceptual design we now have to learn the technical details to build our concepts and string them together into complete software.
