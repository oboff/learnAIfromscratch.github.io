If you search there is lot's of answers to 'how do I learn to program' but not many practical answers to 'how do I make money programming' that don't include trying to do interviews and be an employee. Here we will actually freelance it up for fame and fortune starting with no background, and presumably working a F/T job already in some industry totally different than writing software.

Russian language social media has a movement "вкaтитьcя в aйти" translated "get into the IT sphere" as a way to change careers and escape low salaries there, which is exactly what I did about 9 years ago so I will see if it's still possible to do here in this workshop.

<a href="https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/">Fly.io</a> free tier gives you 3GB persistent storage, 160GB/month outbound bandwidth, and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> certs. It's a 'serverless' hosting scheme where you write an app and deploy it as is, or shove your app into a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> container, and they run it on their global content delivery network. This can be completely automated too. Translated this means we can write customized software for businesses (people who will pay us) and it's turn-key, we can extract out the generic parts of software, make it into our own template to customize to punters for cash or sell it as is.

Web or distributed computing software is now so vast that I decided to target the most abstract frameworks possible which presently is <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> (Elixir language) and launch our software for free on fly.io which runs like fire as they managed to get the Phoenix creator to set it up. We can build and launch a crazy real-time web application with thousands of concurrent users interacting like an auction site or a whatsapp clone, a server for a phone app, a server for a multiplayer game that runs on desktops, bots, sell plugins in software stores like Shopify or GSuite, some kind of personal firewall, anything. Look at <a href="https://www.dealdash.com/">dealdash</a> that's a Phoenix site, yes you can build this yourself.

We have to learn Elixir, a functional language which compiles bytecode to run in the Erlang BEAM virtual machine, and understand it's run-time system. Pattern matching is a common idiom in Elixir programming so we need to learn it, and Elixir's dynamics how expressions are evaluated and run, plus it's type system. Elixir simplifies complexity by breaking up programs into modules, so we need to know modules. We need to know all the developer tooling like generating tests and documentation automatically and common editor plugins like Dialyzer a code analysis tool. We have to learn all the weird abstractions of the OTP behavior modules like actor models and supervision trees which means we need to also learn trees in general. We have to learn software and data design, how do we know our ideas will work and how do we translate it into software that isn't trash. Finally we have to learn how to sell our software or sell ourselves as contractors.. and of course we have to know what we don't know which will come as we go, but no problem.

"What can we teach you here at MIT that you will not learn on the job".

It's worth writing down the definition of a concept:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>purpose: what is the concept for? (one purpose for one concept)</li>
<li>structure: what is the essential data model?</li>
<li>actions: what actions define the behavior? (implementation using basic function signatures)</li>
<li>operational principal: how is this expected to be used? what is the archetypal scenario?</li>

Watching <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZ85ui0k2QpCKgfJZXUPSk-jdSi36MzP/view">Conceptual Design 2</a>. Can you look at the concept and know immediately if that concept is going to work or not before going on to waste your time writing software? "Write down each purpose, make sure each purpose gets it's own concept". He goes through many examples to further explain conceptual design such as the confusion of Gmail's categories vs labels is examined as a design rule violation, spreadsheet software problems, git problems, dropbox non-uniform behavior.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What makes a usable concept?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One-to-one rule: each concept should have one purpose
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>overloading concepts with multiple purposes leads to confusion like the gmail labels/categories</li>
<li>a second purpose needs a second concept</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Uniformity: operational principle is uniform
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>always the same actions irrespective of context unless it would make no sense (example: attaching sent labels to messages you haven't actually sent)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Genericity: reuse familiar concepts instead of inventing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>strange new concept of sections in Powerpoint instead of just a familiar file folder concept used by Keynote</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

As an example of this design method the prof and one of his phd students redesigned git into <a href="https://gitless.com/">gitless</a>. As a concrete example of using this procedure to design Hacker News, see <a href="https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/4415/pages/tuesday-10-slash-13-concept-design-rules?module_item_id=146785">these slides</a> on page 7 and 8.

Watching <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qblmdoZIJQ4rYGgCPLNusEn2yWiq1cxy/view">UX Design &amp; Heuristics I</a> the first 50m are examples of learnability, security, and other design criteria by analyzing a Korean subway turnstile design. The end of the lecture talks about grouping similar things together visually using Google actions as an example that violates this property. One way to do user studies is find software similar to what you plan on designing, and read all the negative reviews, or the feature requests picking out design flaws. For example 'Gunbot' a trading bot uses github issues for feature requests, and many issues are <a href="https://github.com/GuntharDeNiro/GunbotAMA/issues/95">design problems</a>. If you were making your own trading bot, you'd want to go through that list of issues during the conceptual design phase, not that you'd be able to implement all the features of mature software but at least could be aware of them and design for future features you'd want to include.

Most of this is in the above <a href="https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/4415/files/804925?module_item_id=195040">usability cheat sheet</a> the idea being that whatever your service design you go through the heuristics and prove to yourself they are satisfied.

These <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa19/6.170/courseMaterial/topics/topic3/lectureNotes/10_-_html:css:dom/10_-_html:css:dom.pdf">slides</a> are well designed, explaining the basics. If you right-click on any website and inspect the content, you'll see piles of nested div elements so the CSS style sheets can select them and give style rules for that div box. This is considered bad style since anyone using a screen reader will have no idea what's going on without the new HTML tags like &lt;article&gt; but of course you can design it however you want. Our HTML will be generated if you use Phoenix webserver, and we'll use some CSS framework like Tailwind or something.

CSS try <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">https://flukeout.github.io/</a> to crash course yourself on selectors. There's also <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">flexbox</a> training and <a href="https://cssgridgarden.com/">grid</a> training, you're placing a mapping over the page and flexbox allows you to group them in a single line to fit every screen size (like a menu bar at top of page with multiple items) or grid which allows you to group them on multiple lines. Then your website is 'responsive' reacting to changes in screen size. 
</p>

<p>
If you really want to dig deep into CSS and learn it, then see HW Lie's <a href="https://www.wiumlie.no/2006/phd/">thesis</a> understanding all the concepts there, then move up to CSS standards. Learn it in stages from the first spec to the most recent. If you read the thesis you'll see the original plan for CSS was that everyone would have their own style sheets to overrides the website default. In practice no user makes their own CSS because it's way too complicated and sites change too much but that is where the idea of 'the cascade' came from this priority of which CSS sheet to use.    
</p>

<p>
To make it even more confusing you have to refer to sites such as <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-grid">can I use</a> to see what browser versions support what CSS or HTML features. For example Internet Explorer still doesn't support CSS Grid fully. 
</p>

<p>
The Document-Object-Model (DOM) is what you think it is, a tree that models the html elements and you can manipulate it to only change certain things instead of reloading the html. For example you are entering info in a form and after each line a green checkmark appears beside that field, you could manipulate the dom to wait for that event and then trigger an action to change the tree and show the checkmark. The DOM has a standard you can look up to find all the edge cases like how error messages bubble up the tree much like exceptions in programming do that we will shortly learn.

This course so far has given us specific things to do that make the design of software much easier, and you already know a lot about application building without writing a single line of code.  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Conceptual Design</li>
</ul>

<p>
Come up with a purpose, for example AirBnB, you want to show pictures of the property. There are already existing concepts for this, look at the similarity between Vrbo property pictures and AirBnB. A large picture with 4 smaller ones, depending on screen size, and a 'show all photos' button. Look at Expedia listings for private vacation homes, exact same concept a large picture with 4 smaller ones and a 'show more' icon but their icon has more <i>information scent</i> telling you the total number of pictures. All 3 of these sites when you click on a picture give you all the photos on a single page. You would probably want to reuse this concept if you were making a generic site for landlords that want to buy your generic booking software instead of coming up with a new concept because users already know how to use it, and where to look for more pictures. You would break down this concept into show more photos, expand picture, all the functionality needed. You would then create a data model for this which we will soon learn. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Interface Heuristics</li>
</ul>

<p>
Going with the AirBnB example of creating a private site to book properties, while doing the wireframing you go through the usability cheat sheet we were given, making sure your design conforms. Things in context to each other should be nearby, recall the example of that Google app where upon selecting messages there is no indications what to do next, you have to move too far away from that context to select 'Actions'. You at all times want to present the user's current state to them, in the form of breadcrumbs or other information so they know where they are in your application. You absolutely want undo methods for everything.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>API and Data Design</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once we learn these, we are officially application developers and the easy part begins where all we have to do is implement it in code.

Abstract data design modeling is something I haven't seen anywhere else, it's a nice way to plan out exactly what data needs to be stored and the best way to make them into database tables without knowing any sql. It uses sets a datastructure in math we will pickup as we go.
</p>

Watching <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1axvYX7kSWAmxDU451hyCcG-wt880uVoe/view">Abstract Data Design I</a>. This lecture starts at 31:50 with seperation of concerns, if you're interested there's a security lecture before it about cross site req forgery attacks but we will learn all this in the context of Phoenix framework security which mitigates many common webapp attacks (and exposes new ones we have to learn).
</p>

<p>
When he claims this is 'highly abstract' he's not kidding, it will take some time to figure out this style of modeling. @36:29 the cheat sheet is <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/courseMaterial/topics/topic1/studyMaterial/object-models-cheatsheet/data-models-cribsheet.pdf">here</a>. This is merely helpful notation to get you to think about how to represent the data model in a dbms. He absolutely blasted through some conjuction (union) and disjunction (intersection) notation, if you've never seen this kind of notation watch <a href="https://youtu.be/59WX2V7Vjgg">this</a>.
</p>

<p>
Let's walk through his solution for the URL shortner software @53:54 with the data model cheat sheet open. If you didn't see it already, their in class URL shortner program you can either log in and get a permanent shortner or you generate a temporary one that expires with no login.
</p>

<p>
There is a set of all Shortcuts which maps each 'atom' (the shortner code) to the set of atoms in URL (the actual link), because he has taken every URL possible and put it in a set. This happens exactly once because you wouldn't have two URLS for the same shortner code. The set of all Shortcuts has subsets Permanent and Expiring, and Expiring will map to the set of all Dates exactly once since you wouldn't have 2 expiry dates. Every Date also has a membership to Expiry as it's a subset. An account maps to Permanent and a subset of accounts is the User which means every User also has an account, because it's a subset.
</p>

<p>
Reminder this data model is done when you architect the concepts, like the purpose of having a user, which means you need a concept of an account. Then you data design that small part. We'll see in the next lecture how it all fits together, and how you can make a schema for this which translated means how you architect all the database tables.
</p>

<p>
Of all the topics we've done so far, this is one of the most important because it absolutely sucks when you realize you've screwed up your data representation and need to redo things requiring all kinds of sql joins. It's also the hardest thing we will learn, even he screwed up his own model in the lecture so this is something that is learned over time.
